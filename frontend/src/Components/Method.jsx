            Pailin Abroad offers English lessons based on audio conversations
            designed to teach natural, practical, and conversational English.
            Each lesson focuses on a grammar point or key concept, seamlessly
            integrated into real-world dialogue. The dialogues follow Pailin,
            a 21-year-old girl from Thailand, who will be studying abroad at
            UCLA while staying with a host family in Los Angeles. Through her
            journey navigating friendships, love, family, school, work, and
            life in a new country, youâ€™ll gain rich insights into American
            culture, avoid common mistakes Thai learners often face, and most
            importantly, improve your English.
