          You'll learn natural, conversational English with Pailin Abroad - the English that native speakers actually use.
          <br /><br />
          Many ESL resources teach stiff, formal English that sounds awkward in casual conversation. We skip that textbook formality and focus on the real-life conversations you'll have with friends, family, coworkers, romantic interests, and strangers.
          <br /><br />
          Our goal is to help you use English to show your true personality. The characters in Pailin Abroad get excited, sad, angry, annoyed, confused, and embarrassed - just like all of us! Through their real-life dialogues, you'll learn authentic ways to express your feelings in English.

          There are two huge advantages that Pailin Abroad offers for Thai people:
          <br /><br />
          <strong>All content is translated in English and Thai</strong>
          <br />
          Most ESL resources are only available in English, so they're not beginner-friendly! Or, you must use Google Translate for all the content, which leads to wildly inaccurate translations. With Pailin Abroad, you don't have to worry about this - you can just focus on learning.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>All lessons are created by native English speakers who lived in Thailand for years</strong>
          <br />
          Our team understands the unique challenges that Thai people face when learning English. Our Common Mistakes library gives specific insights into the mistakes that Thai people often make, and why. We also offer ways to fix these mistakes!

          <strong>Has this ever happened to you?</strong>
          <br />
          You study English and feel confident in your skills, but then a native speaker talks so quickly and uses so much slang! You freeze, and suddenly all the English you learned has disappeared.
          <br /><br />
          We totally get it! That's what happens when you learn English out of context, usually from outdated textbooks in the classroom.
          <br /><br />
          In real life, you can't always ask people to slow down or repeat themselves. But with Pailin Abroad, you are in control. You can slow down the audio, replay the conversation, and listen as many times as you need until you fully grasp the dialogue. Soon enough, you'll stop translating every single word into Thai in your head, and you'll start naturally understanding English at a real-life pace.
