# Sidebar Section Display Fix for Locked Lessons

## ✅ Issue Fixed

**Problem:** Sidebar was only showing a few sections for locked lessons because it was filtering based on whether arrays (questions, transcript, practiceExercises, phrases) had content.

**Root Cause:**
- Backend returns empty arrays for `questions`, `transcript`, `practice_exercises`, and `phrases` when locked
- Sidebar was checking `if (questions.length)`, `if (transcript.length)`, etc.
- These checks failed for locked lessons, hiding those sections
- Only regular sections (apply, understand, etc.) from the `sections` array were showing

## 🔧 Solution

Added `isLocked` prop to LessonSidebar component with smart fallback logic:

### For Locked Lessons:
- **Comprehension**: Show if `sections` array includes type "comprehension"
- **Transcript**: Show if `sections` array includes type "transcript"
- **Practice**: Show if `sections` array includes type "practice"
- **Phrases & Verbs**: Show if `sections` array includes type "phrases_verbs"
- **Other sections**: Show based on `sections` array (unchanged)

### For Unlocked Lessons:
- All existing logic preserved (checks for actual content in arrays)

## 📝 Code Changes

### 1. LessonSidebar.jsx
```jsx
export default function LessonSidebar({
  // ... existing props
  isLocked = false, // ← NEW PROP
}) {
  const menuItems = MASTER_ORDER.map((type) => {
    if (type === "comprehension") {
      // Show if questions exist OR if locked and section exists
      if (questions.length || (isLocked && sections.some(s => s.type === "comprehension"))) {
        return { id: "comprehension", type };
      }
      return null;
    }
    // Similar logic for transcript, practice, phrases_verbs
    // ...
  })
}
```

**Key Change:** Added fallback checks `|| (isLocked && sections.some(s => s.type === "..."))`

### 2. Lesson.jsx
```jsx
<LessonSidebar
  // ... existing props
  isLocked={isLocked}  // ← PASS isLocked PROP
/>
```

## 🎯 Result

### Before:
```
Sidebar for Locked Lesson:
├─ APPLY
├─ UNDERSTAND
└─ EXTRA TIPS
   (Missing: Comprehension, Transcript, Practice, Phrases)
```

### After:
```
Sidebar for Locked Lesson:
├─ COMPREHENSION  ← Now shows
├─ TRANSCRIPT     ← Now shows
├─ APPLY
├─ UNDERSTAND
├─ EXTRA TIPS
├─ COMMON MISTAKES
├─ PHRASES & VERBS  ← Now shows
├─ CULTURE NOTE
└─ PRACTICE       ← Now shows
```

## 🧪 Behavior

### Locked Lesson:
- ✅ All sections that exist in the `sections` array are shown
- ✅ Clicking any section shows the locked overlay (from LessonContent)
- ✅ User can see full lesson structure even when locked
- ✅ Encourages signup by showing what they're missing

### Unlocked Lesson:
- ✅ Only sections with actual content are shown (no change)
- ✅ Empty sections are still hidden
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing behavior

## 📊 Data Flow

```
Backend (locked: true)
  ↓
  sections: [full array with metadata]
  questions: []  ← empty
  transcript: [] ← empty
  practice_exercises: [] ← empty
  phrases: [] ← empty
  ↓
Frontend Lesson.jsx
  ↓
  isLocked = true
  ↓
LessonSidebar (isLocked={true})
  ↓
  Checks: sections.some(s => s.type === "comprehension") ✓
  Checks: sections.some(s => s.type === "transcript") ✓
  Checks: sections.some(s => s.type === "practice") ✓
  ↓
  Shows ALL sections from sections array
```

## ✅ Files Modified

1. `/frontend/src/Components/LessonSidebar.jsx`
   - Added `isLocked` prop parameter
   - Added conditional logic for each section type
   - Checks `sections` array when `isLocked` is true

2. `/frontend/src/Pages/Lesson.jsx`
   - Passes `isLocked={isLocked}` to LessonSidebar component

## 🎨 User Experience

Users viewing locked lessons now see:
1. ✅ **Full lesson structure** in sidebar
2. ✅ **All available sections** listed
3. ✅ **Locked overlay** when clicking any section
4. ✅ **Clear value proposition** - they can see what they're missing

This creates better conversion because users understand the full scope of content they'll get access to when they sign up!
