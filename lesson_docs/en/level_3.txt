How to use the word ‘sorry’


________________




SORRY


‘Sorry’ is a very important word to know. It’s used to apologize for a wide range of situations, from small inconveniences to major incidents. It can be said by itself or as part of a sentence. You can add the word ‘so’ before sorry to make it stronger.


* Sorry.
* I’m sorry.
* I’m so sorry.


'Sorry’ can be used for all sorts of situations!


Minor incident:


You bump into someone:
* Oops, sorry!


You ask someone a question, but realize that you interrupted a conversation:
* Sorry, I’ll ask you my question later.


Accidents:


You broke your friend’s mug:
* So sorry, Sylvie, but I broke your mug when I was washing it.


You spilled wine on your friend’s nice jacket.
* I’m so sorry. Let me try to wash the stain out now.


Deep regret:


You and your brother had a huge argument earlier, and you want to apologize for the hurtful things you said.
* I’m so sorry about what I said. I crossed a line.


You promised your friend you would help her move out, but you can’t come anymore because you got called into work.
* I’m so sorry, but I can’t help you move today. I just got called into work.


________________




SORRY + REASON


A simple way to apologize is:

Sorry + (reason you’re sorry).


The reason should be a complete sentence. Here are examples from the conversation:


* Sorry we’re late!
We're late! = the reason Mark is sorry


* Sorry the house is a little messy.
The house is a little messy = the reason Sylvie is sorry


You can also apologize for someone else’s mishap. When Emily asks Pailin a rather personal question, Sylvie apologies for Emily’s behavior:


* Sorry, she's so rude.


Here are more examples of using 'sorry' in this way:


* I'm so sorry I said that to you.
* Sorry I forgot your birthday.
* I'm sorry I wasn't paying attention.


________________




SORRY FOR (VERB-ING)


Notice how Luke apologizes to Pailin when he accidentally drops her suitcase:


* I'm so sorry for dropping your suitcase!


He gives a specific reason for his apology, but he uses a different structure:


Sorry for (verb-ing)
Sorry for not (verb-ing)


In Luke’s apology, the base verb is ‘drop’, but -ing is added so it becomes ‘dropping’ in this sentence. Here are examples of the three sentences from the section above, but using this structure. The base verb is shown in (parenthesis):


* I’m so sorry for saying that to you. (say)
* Sorry for forgetting your birthday. (forget)
* I’m sorry for not paying attention. (pay)


You can use ‘sorry for (verb-ing),’ or you can use ‘sorry + reason’ and the meaning is the same! You can choose whichever one you want to use.


________________




THAT’S OKAY


There are several ways to respond to someone who has apologized to you. In the conversation, Sylvie apologizes to Pailin for Emily's embarrassing question. Also, Luke apologizes for dropping Pailin's suitcase. Pailin responds with:


* That's okay!
* It's okay!


These are typical ways to respond if an incident or inconvenience isn’t a big deal. Then, when Sylvie apologizes to Pailin about the house being a little messy, Pailin reassures Sylvie by saying:


* Don't worry!


You can also say:


* No worries!


The above four phrases are best used for minor inconveniences.


Here are other ways to respond to ‘sorry’:


* I understand.
You can say this when someone gives you a valid excuse for why they can’t help you or do something for you. When you tell them, 'I understand,' it shows empathy and acknowledges their situation.


* Adam: Sorry I can’t come to your birthday party. I want to go, but I promised my sister I would babysit her kids.
Chloe: It’s okay, I understand.


* Don’t be sorry.
You can say this when someone is overly apologetic about something small and you don’t want them to feel guilty.


* Pailin: I’m so sorry I lost your shirt. I don’t know where it could be.
Tyler: Don’t be sorry. It was an old shirt.

EXTRA TIPS


SORRY TO SHOW SYMPATHY


When someone is experiencing hardship or misfortune, you can say 'I'm so sorry' to show empathy and acknowledge their pain. This expression is used to offer support during difficult times, such as the death of a loved one, health issues, a divorce or breakup, or any other challenging life circumstances. For example:


* I'm so sorry for your loss.
* I'm so sorry you're going through this.


Note that this use of 'sorry' expresses sympathy, not responsibility for the other person's situation.


________________




APOLOGIZING FOR FUTURE EVENTS


To apologize for something that might happen in the future and potentially cause inconvenience or discomfort, you can follow this structure:


Sorry if (reason you’re sorry).


The reason should be a complete sentence in present simple tense, even though the event would potentially happen in the future. For example:


* Sorry if I wake you up in the morning.
I wake you up in the morning = the reason you're sorry


* Sorry if I come late. There’s so much traffic today.
* Sorry if I forget your name. I’m so bad with names.
* Sorry if my phone rings during the meeting. I’m expecting a call.


________________




NO, SORRY


When you're unable to fulfill a simple request or answer a question, you can respond with:


* No, sorry.
* I don't know, sorry.


Adding ‘sorry’ is a polite way to acknowledge the minor inconvenience.


For example:


* Pailin: Do you have any change for the parking meter?
Luke: No, sorry.


* Pailin: Excuse me, do you know where the metro station is?
Stranger: I don’t know, sorry. I’m not from around here.


PHRASES & VERBS


Guys = (an informal, friendly term to address a group of people, regardless of gender)
* Hey guys, how’s it going?
* Guys, we’re going to be late if we don’t leave now.


See more uses of ‘Guys’


Oh no = (an expression to show alarm or concern, especially when something goes wrong)
* Oh no. I locked my keys in my car!


See more uses of 'Oh no'
CULTURE NOTE


SORRY!


Unlike ขอโทษ, 'sorry' is used for a broader range of situations. It covers serious apologies for causing harm, but also light, everyday interactions where others might find it unnecessary to apologize.


For example, say a server at a restaurant mistakenly brings you a salad. You might say, ‘Sorry, I actually ordered a burger’ even though it’s the server’s mistake.


Canadians are particularly known for reflexively saying ‘sorry’ all the time, even when they’ve done nothing wrong. Like if someone steps on their foot, they might say ‘Sorry!’ even though the other person is at fault.


In instances like these, ‘sorry’ is more of a polite filler word than a real apology.

How to make negative sentences with ‘don’t’ and ‘doesn’t’
Verb tense: Present simple tense


________________




NEGATIVE SENTENCES


So far, you’ve learned how to make affirmative sentences in present simple tense (I drink coffee every morning). In this lesson, you’ll learn how to make those sentences negative using the words ‘don’t’ and ‘doesn’t.’


Compare these two sentences from the conversation:

* I don't like my classes.
* He doesn't like it very much.


In Lesson 1.16, you learned that ‘not’ is used to negate ALL verbs in English. The two sentences above contain the word ‘not,’ although it may not be obvious at first glance. That’s because ‘not’ is contracted with the auxiliary verb ‘do’ or ‘does’.


don’t = do not
doesn’t = does not


These two words make present simple tense sentences negative. Notice their position in the sentences. They come after the subject and before the main verb:


(Subject) don’t (verb)
(Subject) doesn’t (verb)


Now take a look at the main verb in these lines from the conversation:


* My friend wants to try Engineering.
* My dad doesn't want me to change my major.


In the first sentence, -s is added to the end of verb ‘want’ because it follows ‘he · she · it · noun.’ What do you notice about the second sentence? The verb ‘want’ doesn’t have an -s even though the subject is ‘he’. Instead, the negative auxiliary verb ‘do not’ takes the -s to become ‘does not,’ while the main verb ‘want’ stays in its base form.


________________




USES & STRUCTURE


Remember that present simple tense is used to talk about routines, habits, feelings, and general knowledge, like facts and widely accepted truths. In the same way, negative present simple tense is used to describe things that don’t happen regularly, or for things you don’t know, feel, or believe.


Here is the structure of ‘don’t’ and ‘doesn’t in a sentence with some examples.

COMMON MISTAKES


        MISTAKE #1


Thai people often only use the word ‘not’ to make a sentence negative. Remember that ‘not’ is always used in conjunction with another verb to make a sentence negative, like in ‘It isn’t hot’ or ‘She doesn’t eat spicy food.’


Take a look at the incorrect sentences below and how to fix them:


I not have a dog. (X)
* I don’t have a dog. (✓)


They not eat fish. (X)
* They don’t eat fish. (✓)


He not like spicy food. (X)
* He doesn’t like spicy food. (✓)


________________




MISTAKE #2


It’s also common for Thai people to mistakenly use ‘don’t’ in negative sentences when they should use ‘doesn’t.' Building the habit of using both correctly will make your English more accurate and fluent. Take a look at the corrections below:


She don’t drink beer. (X)
* She doesn’t drink beer. (✓)


He don’t work there. (X)
* He doesn’t work there. (✓)


It don’t smell bad. (X)
* It doesn’t smell bad. (✓)

LESSON FOCUS


How to use articles (a · an) before a noun


English uses 'articles,' which are small words that come before nouns. There are no articles at all in Thai! The three articles are: a, an, the. This lesson focuses on ‘a’ and ‘an.’


________________




ARTICLES 'A’ & ‘AN'


Take a look at the underlined nouns in these lines:


* Sometimes I make a sandwich.
* I usually just have a cup of coffee and an apple in the morning.
* I need a big breakfast.


Notice the small words that come before these nouns: ‘a’ and ‘an.’ These words are called ‘articles’ and are used very often in English. Although they’re small and don’t add meaning to a sentence, they’re very important for fluency. For example, saying ‘I need big breakfast’ sounds incomplete compared to ‘I need a big breakfast.’


‘A’ and ‘an’ come before a singular, non-specific noun.


‘Singular’ means there is only one noun. You can think of ‘a · an’ as meaning ‘one.’ In Thai, you would specify if there’s ‘one’ noun only if it’s important to the conversation’s context, for example: ฉันมีหมาหนึ่งตัว แต่พี่ชายมีสองตัว. But in English, the use of articles means it’s always clear if you are referring to one item or more than one item. When you say, ‘I ate a banana,’ it’s clear you ate one banana.


‘Non-specific’ means you are not talking about a specific item. Another article (the) is used for this, which you’ll learn about in the next lesson. For example, if you say ‘I saw a dog,’ this means you saw any dog, while if you say ‘I saw Jane’s dog,’ you are referring to a specific dog.


These concepts will become clearer as you see more examples.


________________




A VS. AN


Take a look at these lines from the conversation:


* I eat a banana...
* But sometimes I eat an orange, too.


One sentence uses ‘a,’ and the other uses ‘an.’ Deciding which to use depends on the first sound of the word after the article.


        an (the next word begins with a vowel sound – a, e, i, o, u)
        a (the next word begins with a non-vowel sound - called ‘consonants’)


What’s the first sound in the word ‘banana?’ ‘Buh!’ Because ‘buh’ is a consonant sound, you need to use the article ‘a’ before this word. What about the first sound in ‘orange?’ It’s ‘oh!’ That’s a vowel sound, so ‘an’ would come before it.


The reason ‘an’ is used before vowel sounds is for flow and ease of pronunciation - saying ‘a orange’ is awkward compared to saying ‘an orange.’ You can see this in more examples from the conversation:


* Usually an egg and bacon sandwich.
* You sound like an old man.


Pronunciation note: ‘a’ as an article isn’t pronounced like the letter ‘A’, but is pronounced more like ‘uh.’


________________




NOUNS & NOUN PHRASES


The articles ‘a’ and ‘an’ come before nouns, but they also come before noun phrases, which is an adjective + noun. In a noun phrase, choosing ‘a’ and ‘an’ depends on the first letter of the adjective, not the noun. Note that articles never come before adjectives alone - only adjectives that are followed by a noun.


In the conversation, Sylvie tells Mark:


* You sound like an old man.


In this line, 'old man' is the noun phrase.
Old = adjective
Man = noun


You must use 'an' since the next word starts with the letter 'o', which is a vowel.


Here are more examples of ‘a’ before nouns and noun phrases:


* Emily wants a dog. (noun)
* I’d like a glass of water, please. (noun)
* Pailin goes to a good school. (noun phrase)
* That was a bad movie. (noun phrase)


And here are more examples of ‘an’ before nouns and noun phrases:


* I have an idea. (noun)
* Do you have an umbrella? (noun)
* It’s an easy task. (noun phrase)
* I’m wearing an orange shirt. (noun phrase)


EXTRA TIPS


H & U


English spelling can sometimes be misleading. Some words begin with a silent ‘h’, so when they’re pronounced, they actually begin with a vowel sound, like the word ‘hour’ or ‘honest.’ Use ‘an’ before these words. For example:


* We have an hour for lunch.
* She's an honest person.


Some words begin with the vowel ‘u’, but when pronounced, it sounds like a ‘y’ sound, like the word ‘university’ or 'European.' Use ‘a’ before these words. For example:


* My daughter is a university student.
* That's a European car.


That's why the rules for using 'a · an' focus on the first sound of the next word, not the spelling.


COMMON MISTAKES


FORGOTTEN ARTICLES


Since articles aren’t a grammar concept that exists in Thai, they’re easily forgotten. However, they will make your speech sound natural and fluent when used correctly. Take a look at the incorrect sentences below and how to fix them.


I read book before bed. (X)
* I read a book before bed. (✓)


He has old dog. (X)
* He has an old dog. (✓)


Try listening to the correct sentences and repeating after the audio, making sure you include the articles.

CULTURE NOTE


BREAKFAST FOODS


American breakfasts are often centered around convenience and tend to be sweet. Popular options are cereal, yogurt, toast, eggs, or oatmeal. While pancakes, waffles, and French toast are iconic American breakfast foods, they aren't eaten on a daily basis, but rather might be eaten one day a week with the family.


In contrast, Thai breakfasts are generally hearty meals and tend to be savory. A cooked meal of rice or sticky rice served with meat is common, showing a preference for substantial, flavorful breakfasts. This contrasts with the American tendency to eat quick, sugary, and easily prepared foods to start the day.




PRACTICE


PRACTICE USING ARTICLES


Enter ‘a’ or ‘an’ in the sentences.


1. Do you have __ job?
2. __ old man is outside our door.
3. It’s __ funny movie.
4. He rides __ bike to work.

How to use the article ‘the’ before a noun


BACKSTORY
Pailin has recently moved into her host family's home. She's chatting with her host brother Luke.


CONVERSATION


Pailin: Luke, what’s the Wi-Fi password?
Luke: It’s on the fridge. Check the yellow paper.
Pailin: Oh, I see it. Thanks!
Luke: The internet is super slow today.

UNDERSTAND


        LESSON FOCUS


How to use the article ‘the’ before a noun


In the previous lesson, you learned about the two articles ‘a’ and ‘an.’ There is one more article: the.


Fun fact: ‘The’ is the most commonly used word in the English language.


________________




‘THE’ FOR SPECIFIC THINGS


Recall that ‘articles’ are small words that come before nouns. There are three articles: a, an, the. The key difference between ‘a · an’ and ‘the’ is:


a · an - used for non-specific things
the - used for specific things


Take a look at this line from the conversation with the noun of focus underlined:


* Check the yellow paper.


Luke tells Pailin that she can find the Wi-Fi password on a specific yellow paper that's on the fridge. Because he is being specific, it is incorrect to say 'Check a yellow paper.' Then, Luke says to Pailin:


* The coffee shop down the street has good Wi-Fi.


Again, he is referring to one specific coffee shop - the one down the street. Contrast this with a sentence like, 'A coffee shop will have good Wi-Fi.' If Luke said this, it means that any coffee shop will have good internet, so he would use 'a' instead of 'the.' But he wants to direct Pailin to a specific coffee shop nearby, so he says 'the coffee shop.'


See more explanations of the lines from the conversation below:


* What’s the WIFI password?
There is only one specific WIFI password that Pailin is asking for.


* It's on the fridge.
Most homes have only one refrigerator, making it a specific object.


* The internet is super slow today.
A household typically has one internet service, and Luke is referring to that specific internet connection.


* The library is also nearby.
In a neighborhood, there's usually one main library that everyone is familiar with. Luke is referring to the one that's closest to their home.


________________




‘THE’ FOR UNIQUE ITEMS


Take a look at this line from the conversation:


* The internet is super slow today.


Although Luke is referring to the internet connection specifically in their home, 'the internet' in general is unique since there is only one internet. ‘An internet’ is never said because the idea of multiple internets doesn’t exist.


So for nouns that are unique, ‘the’ is the article used before, not ‘a · an.’ There are many different ‘unique nouns,’ so here are some select examples where ‘the’ should come before:


Physical environment: the stars, the moon, the grass, the ocean, the weather
Systems and services: the police, the news, the electricity, the government
Government positions: the Queen, the president
Concepts: the economy, the future, the world


________________




‘THE’ FOR SPECIFIC THINGS ALREADY MENTIONED


When you mention an item for the first time in a conversation, you should use ‘a’ or ‘an’ because it’s new information for the listener. However, after that item is mentioned, you should say ‘the’ because now it’s something that is known to both the speaker and listener. ‘The’ shows that the item is now a particular or familiar thing that everyone in the conversation is aware of.Here is an example:


* Pailin: I saw a good movie yesterday.
Luke: What was the movie about?
Pailin: The movie was about a man who traveled around the world.


In the beginning, Pailin says 'a good movie' because she's introducing the movie for the first time. She's not referring to a specific movie that Luke already knows about. It's a general introduction.  Then, once the 'good movie' is introduced into the conversation, Luke and Pailin can refer to it as 'the movie' because they both know which movie they're referring to. It's now specific.


Here is another example referencing a person:


* Mark: We have a new employee on the team.
Assistant: Is the employee starting work this week?
Mark: I think so.


At first, Mark uses ‘a’ because he is introducing the employee into the conversation for the first time. The employee is unknown to the assistant. She doesn’t know who the new employee is or any details about them.


But once Mark introduces this employee into the conversation, the employee becomes known to both people in the conversation. Now they are both talking about the same person. So, the assistant uses ‘the’ because she is referring to the specific employee that Mark just mentioned. Later in the day, if the assistant wants to ask Mark more questions about this new employee, she will continue to say ‘the employee,’ rather than ‘a new employee.’


There are several more ways to use ‘the,’ which you can learn about in the Extra Tips section.


________________




'THE' BEFORE SINGULAR & PLURAL NOUNS


You learned in the previous lesson that 'a · an' is used before singular nouns only, meaning there is only one item or person. However, 'the' can be used before any quantity of people or things. For example:


* The book is about a woman who becomes a chef.
* The books on the shelf are old.


* Can I eat the last cookie?
* I ate all the cookies you baked.


The words ‘books’ and ‘cookies’ refer to more than one book and more than one cookie, yet ‘the’ can still be used.


EXTRA TIPS


'THE' FOR SPECIFIC THINGS IN ONE ENVIRONMENT


'The' is used when talking about a specific place that everyone knows is the main one in your surroundings. When Luke refers to 'the library,' he isn't talking about any library. He's referring to the library that is most likely known or understood by Pailin in their current setting. It's the 'default' library, or the one considered the most obvious or accessible. This concept applies to other places you might go to in your neighborhood, such as:


the beach
* Let's go to the beach.
There are beaches all over the world, but the listener will understand that you want to go to the main beach in your area.


the bathroom
* I need to go to the bathroom.
It's understood that you want to use whichever bathroom is closest.


the park
* My kids are playing at the park.
This implies a park in your neighborhood.


More examples:
the hospital
the airport
the museum
the movies
the lake
the post office
the bank
the bus station
the mall


________________




'THE' BEFORE SUPERLATIVES


'The' is used before words that describe something as the 'most' or 'best' of its kind, like 'the tallest' or 'the fastest.' There can only be one specific thing that's 'the most,' which explains why 'the' is used. These words are called 'superlatives,' which you'll learn about in Lesson 8.11. Here are some example sentences:


* Sarah is the smartest person in our class.
* This is the best Thai restaurant in LA.
* New Zealand is the most beautiful country I've been to.


________________




'THE' BEFORE TRANSPORTATION & INSTRUMENTS


When referring to a mode of transportation or a musical instrument as a concept, you should use 'the.' For example:


* I take the bus to work.
* The subway is clean and reliable in Tokyo.
* She plays the piano very well.
* I want to learn how to play the guitar.


However, context is important. When referring to a single instrument or vehicle, then 'a · an' might be used instead. For example:


* We took a taxi to the airport.
* She bought a piano.


PHRASES & VERBS


Oh no (to show alarm)


PRACTICE


'THE' VS 'A · AN'


Decide if the article before the noun should be 'the,' 'an', or 'a.'


Yesterday, I went to (the / a) pet store. I saw (a) parrot. (The) parrot was very colorful. I also saw (a) small puppy. (The) puppy was sleeping in (a) cage. I asked (an / the) employee about (the) price for (the) puppy. She told me it's quite expensive. So I bought (a) bag of cat food for my cat instead.

LESSON FOCUS


How to use plural nouns


In Lesson 3.3, you learned what to say before a singular noun: 'a' or 'an'. In this lesson, you'll learn what to say if there is more than one noun. These are called plural nouns.


________________




PLURAL NOUNS


In the conversation, Sylvie and Pailin are browsing in a flower shop. Sylvie says:


* These roses smell amazing!
* Let's get some flowers for the living room.


Notice that the articles 'a' and 'an' aren’t before the words ‘roses’ and ‘flowers.’ That's because Sylvie is referring to multiple items. There are many roses that Sylvie can see, not just one. Then Sylvie suggests they get 'some' flowers for the living room, not just one flower.


The words ‘roses’ and ‘flowers’ are examples of ‘plural nouns.’ A plural noun represents multiple people, places, or things. Just by looking at the words ‘roses’ or ‘flowers,’ you can tell that there is more than one rose or flower because they are in their plural form.


In contrast, a ‘singular noun’ represents one person, place, or thing. The words ‘rose’ and ‘flower’ are singular nouns. Just by looking at these words, you can tell that there is only one rose or flower because they are in their singular form. To summarize:


Singular noun: One person, place, or thing
Examples: dog, kid, magazine, house


Plural noun: 2 or more people, places, or things
Examples: dogs, kids, magazines, houses


Note: Remember that the articles ‘a’ and ‘an’ only come before singular nouns, while ‘the’ can come before both singular and plural nouns.


________________




MAKING PLURAL NOUNS


Compare these two lines from the conversation:


* I like the blue vase.
* The vases are over there.


Do you see how the word ‘vase’ changed? It went from ‘vase’ to ‘vases.’ An -s was added to the end of the noun. This is generally how plural nouns are formed. The following lines from the conversation all have plural nouns. See if you can spot them:


* Let’s get some flowers for the living room.
* It’s 3 dollars for 1 lily.
* Do you sell vases?


They are the words ‘flowers,’ ‘dollars,’ and ‘vases.’




SINGULAR NOUN
	PLURAL NOUN
	flower
	flowers
	dollar
	dollars
	vase
	vases




________________




APPLYING PLURAL NOUNS


Sometimes, it’s simple to know when to use plural nouns. When specifying a quantity, you would use the singular noun for 1, and the plural noun for amounts of 2 or more. For example:


* It’s 3 dollars for 1 lily.
* I’ll take 5 lilies, please.


‘Dollars’ is plural because the worker specifies 3 of them. ‘Lily’ is singular in the first sentence because she specifies 1 of them. In the next line, ‘lilies’ is plural because Sylvie requests 5 of them.


Those are more obvious scenarios. Sometimes, words like ‘some’ or ‘many’ indicate that you should use the plural noun. In other scenarios, using the singular noun versus plural noun depends on the context. Imagine you’re at an electronics store shopping for a new phone. Take a look at when you might use the singular and plural version of ‘phone’:


You’re looking at a specific phone that you like, when you notice the price:
* I like this phone.
You should use the singular ‘phone’ because you are referring to only one phone, the one that you’re interested in.


* These phones are on sale.
The plural ‘phones’ should be used if multiple phones are on sale.


Although the meaning of the conversation might not change with singular or plural nouns, they're very important to use correctly if you want to sound like a native speaker.


________________




IRREGULAR PLURAL NOUNS


In the conversation, Sylvie says:


* My children love lilies.


'Children' is a plural noun, but it doesn't have an -s at the end. Do you know what the singular noun is? It's 'child.' There are some words in English that don't follow the rule of adding -s to become plural, and instead just become a different word. These are called irregular plural nouns. Here are some common irregular plural nouns:




SINGULAR NOUN
	PLURAL NOUN
	a man
	men
	a women
	women
	a child
	children
	a person
	people
	a foot
	feet
	a tooth
	teeth


EXTRA TIPS


SUBJECT-VERB AGREEMENT


You've learned that verbs are conjugated differently for subjects of 1 noun or 2+ nouns. Now, you can put a name to these: singular noun and plural nouns. Here is a recap:






SUBJECT
	VERB
	EXAMPLE SENTENCES
	(Plural noun)
	are

* My dog loves the dog park.
* That woman doesn’t eat pork.




________________




WHEN THERE ARE 0 ITEMS


You've learned that singular nouns refer to 1 noun, while plural nouns refer to 2 or more nouns. Interestingly, when there are 0 nouns, the plural noun is used in the sentence! For example:


* I don't have any sisters.
* There aren't any dishes in the sink.
* This shop doesn't sell notebooks.
* I have no plans for the weekend.




________________




PLURAL NOUNS FOR GENERAL QUESTIONS


In the conversation, Sylvie asks the worker:


* Do you sell vases?


She uses the plural noun 'vases' instead of the singular noun 'vase' because she's asking a general question of whether the store sells a category of items. The store potentially sells multiple kinds of vases, so using the plural noun makes her question broader and more inclusive. It would sound unnatural for Sylvie to ask 'Do you sell a vase?'


Here are more examples:


* How many countries have you visited?
* Do you like dogs?
* Are there any restaurants open late?




COMMON MISTAKES


THE -S SOUND


Thai people often omit the -s sound at the end of plural nouns. Although remembering to use plural nouns can be difficult, pronouncing the -s will make you sound more like a native speaker! Try developing good habits now. See how to fix the incorrect sentence below:


I brought some orange. (X)
* I brought some oranges. (✓)


She has two brother. (X)
* She has two brothers. (✓)


Try listening to the correct sentences and repeating after the audio, making sure you enunciate the -s sound.

PRACTICE


SINGULAR TO PLURAL NOUN


Change the amount in the following sentences from 'one' to 'two.' Don't forget to update the singular noun into a plural noun. Type the full sentence into the answer box. For example: She owns two cars.


1. He wants one cupcake.
2. We have one child.
3. I wrote one book.
4. They brought one camera.
5. I saw one person.

PLURAL NOUNS VS SINGULAR NOUNS


The noun in (parenthesis) should either be a singular noun or a plural noun in the following sentences. Use context clues to determine which is correct to use.


1. Do you have any ____ (sibling)?
2. Our home has a ____ (yard).
3. The ____ (student) are in the classroom.
4. He sang many ____ (song).
5. I bought three ____ (ticket).

Pailin: Cool! What about this?
Luke: That’s my mom’s jewelry box. It was my grandma’s before that.
Pailin: It's beautiful. And what's this?

APOSTROPHE -S


Take a look at this line from the conversation:


* This is my grandpa's watch.


Whose watch is it? It's Luke's grandpa's watch. Notice the bolded 'apostrophe -s' added to 'grandpa' indicates that the watch belongs to his grandpa. When spoken, you simply add an -s sound after the owner’s name. Here is the structure:


(the owner)'s (noun)


This possessive form shows a connection between two things, whether it's ownership, a relationship, or a characteristic. There are examples of each in the conversation:


* Do you like Emily's paintings? (ownership)
* My dad's friend fixed it last year. (a relationship)
* That's my mom's jewelry box. (ownership)
* This is my grandma's cookbook. (ownership)
* My grandma's cooking was amazing. (a characteristic)


________________




OMITTING THE NOUN


Notice there isn’t a noun after ‘Emily’s’ in this sentence:


* These are Emily's?


Pailin doesn't have to say 'These are Emily's paintings?' because the noun was already mentioned in the previous sentence when Luke asks 'Do you like Emily's paintings?' The same occurs in this line:


* That's my mom's jewelry box. It was my grandma's before that.


There isn’t a noun after ‘grandma’s’ because the noun ‘jewelry box’ was already mentioned in the previous sentence. So, you can omit the noun when it's clear what you're talking about. This is different from possessive adjectives, which you learned about in Lesson 2.9. Remember that possessive adjectives (my · your · her…) also show possession, but they must come before a noun. You cannot omit the noun after it.


* A: I like this jacket.
B: Thanks, it’s my jacket. (✓)
B. Thanks, it's my. (X)


EXTRA TIPS


STACKING MULTIPLE NOUNS


Sometimes, you may want to show how several people or things are connected through relationships. This is done by adding -'s to each 'owner' word in the sentence. For example:


* Jill's boyfriend's dad came to our Christmas party.
* I've never been to my wife's brother's house.
* My neighbor's mom's dog was barking all night.


Just note that excessively stacking these words can get confusing for listeners. They might have a hard time following 'So I was at my best friend's dad's new wife's grandma's sister's house the other day...'




COMMON MISTAKES


THE -S SOUND


Thai students often omit the -'s sound when describing ownership. Take a look at the incorrect sentences and how to fix them:


This is my mom car. (X)
* This is my mom's car. (✓)


Sarah daughter is a student here. (X)
* Sarah's daughter is a student here. (✓)


Try listening to the correct sentences and repeating after the audio, making sure you enunciate the -s sound.


You've now learned four key uses of adding an -s to the end of a word:


Contracting 'is' to a subject (It's hot.)
3rd person verb conjugation (He works at Google.)
Plural nouns (Do you like burgers?)
Possessive 's (These are Emily's paintings.)


Remember that adding the -s sound at the end of words is a good habit to build now, as a beginner. It'll significantly help you sound more fluent as your English progresses!


PHRASES & VERBS


WOW


COOL


GREAT IDEA
Great idea = (said to show enthusiastic approval of a suggestion or plan)
* Luke: Oh, it’s happy hour at Jay’s Bar. Should we go there?
Pailin: Yeah, great idea!


PRACTICE


PRACTICE APOSTROPHE -S


Combine the two sentences to form one sentence. Make sure to add -'s when applicable. For example: My dad has a car. His car is green. --> My dad's car is green.


1. Jill has a friend. Her friend is Thai.
(Jill's friend is Thai.)
2. My friend has a dog. The dog's name is Max.
(My friend's dog's name is Max.)
3. My boss has an office. The office is large.
(My boss's office is large.)
4. His family has a house. The house is by the lake.
(His family's house is by the lake.)

LESSON FOCUS


How to use 'Let's (verb)'


In the conversation, Pailin gets a phone call from Anthony, an old friend of hers who's in LA for a few days. He suggests a few things to Pailin:


* Let's meet up.
* Let's try the new ice cream shop in Hollywood.
* Let's meet there in 20 minutes.


These sentences are used to casually make suggestions or propose activities that involve the speaker and others in the conversation. They follow this structure:


Let's (verb).
Let's = Let us


There isn't a subject in these sentences because the implied subject is 'we.'


At the end of the conversation, Pailin says to Chloe:


* Let's go.


This is a useful phrase that you will use often when you are ready to leave a place. Other useful phrases with 'let's' include:


* Let's eat! (said before you begin eating a meal)
* Let's begin. (a suggestion to start an activity or meeting)
* Let's hang out. (a suggestion to meet with a friend casually)
* Let's take a break. (a suggestion to pause an activity)
EXTRA TIPS


LET'S SEE


The phrase 'Let's see' has two common uses.


1. 'Let's see' is used as a filler phrase when you are pausing to think or trying to remember something. It's a way to buy time while you think about your response.


* Luke: What time should we leave for the airport?
Pailin: Let's see, our flight is at 9, so let's leave around 6.
Pailin is calculating the time needed to get to their flight on time.


* Pailin: How many people are coming to your party?
Luke: There are...let's see, around 30 people coming.
Luke is trying to count an approximate number.


2. 'Let's see' is used when you want to observe the outcome of a situation, or want to try something out. It shows curiosity or an attempt to experiment.


* Luke: Someone left a note on my car.
Pailin: Ooh, let's see what it says.
Pailin is curious about what is on the note.


* Pailin: I'm not sure what to order. Everything on the menu looks so good.
Luke: Let's see what the waiter recommends.
Luke wants to try the waiter's recommendations, since they can't decide what to order.


________________




LET'S GO


The phrase ‘Let’s go’ is typically said when you’re ready to leave a place. But it’s also used casually in two more ways:


1. ‘Let’s go!’ can be used to show excitement for something happening now, or to show enthusiasm when your friend shares great news with you. It’s not used to talk about actually going to a place when used in this context.


* Pailin: I won free tickets to the game tonight!
Luke: Let’s go!


2. ‘Let’s go’ can be used to motivate or encourage a sports team or player, especially when you’re a spectator.


* Let's go Lakers!


COMMON MISTAKES


THE -S SOUND


Thai students often omit the -s sound in 'Let's'. Take a look at the incorrect sentences and how to fix them:


Let go to the mall. (X)
* Let's go to the mall. (✓)


Let get some food. (X)
* Let's get some food. (✓)


Try listening to the correct sentences and repeating after the audio, making sure you enunciate the -s sound.


PHRASES & VERBS


MEET UP


Meet up = (to plan an informal and casual meeting)
* Let’s meet up for coffee this week.
* We’re going to meet up with friends tonight.


        THAT SOUNDS FUN


That sounds fun = (used to show that someone’s proposal is a good one)
* Pailin: Do you wanna play mini-golf with us tonight?
Luke: Sure, that sounds fun.


OF COURSE


Of course = แน่นอน
* Of course you can stay at my place! You don’t even have to ask.

APPLY


In the conversation, Anthony asks Pailin and Chloe what flavor ice cream they want. Imagine you're with two of your friends at a Thai restaurant. Ask them about an item on the menu that you'd like to share with them. Try using 'you guys' in your question.


UNDERSTAND


LESSON FOCUS


How to address multiple people with 'you guys'




YOU GUYS


You've learned about these useful pronouns:
I · you · we · they · he · she · it


But what should you use if you're addressing two or more people? Notice what the worker at the ice cream shop says to Pailin, Chloe, and Anthony:


* How are you guys today?


He uses the phrase 'you guys.' This is a common and informal way to address 2 or more people. ‘You guys’ is used multiple times in the conversation:


* Do you guys want some samples?
* What flavor do you guys want?
* Are you guys paying together or separately?


While 'guys' traditionally refers to men, it's now widely used in informal speech to address all people, regardless of gender. Anthony says 'you guys' even when talking to two women, Pailin and Chloe.


Notice that 'you guys' follows the same verb conjugation pattern as 'you · we · they,' since it's a plural subject:


* Are you guys paying together or separately?
* Are they paying together or separately?


Here are more examples of 'you guys' in a sentence:


* I'll see you guys later.
* You guys should try this new restaurant.
* Where are you guys going on vacation?



EXTRA TIPS


'GUYS' & 'EVERYONE'


In the conversation, Anthony tells Pailin and Chloe:


* It's my treat, guys.


When getting the attention of 2 or more people, you can address them by 'you guys' or simply 'guys.' For example:


* Guys, look at this!
* Come over here, guys!
* You guys, what time should we leave?


Remember that any gender can use the terms 'you guys' or 'guys.' A woman can say to her two female friends, 'Guys, where should we eat?'


In larger group settings, you can also use the word 'everyone.' This is a more gender-neutral term and is more formal than 'guys.' For example, a teacher on a field trip with her students might say:


* Everyone, follow me!


________________




GUYS & GIRLS


You’ve learned that ‘guys’ is a gender-neutral way to address a group of people of any gender. But ‘guys’ can be used to talk specifically about a group of boys or men when you are talking about them, not directly to them. For example:


* We have 50 spots for girls and 50 spots for guys.
* Will there be other guys at the party?
If you invited a male friend to your house party, he might ask this to find out if he will be the only man there, or if there will be other men there too.




COMMON MISTAKES


THE -S SOUND


Thai students often omit the -s sound in 'guys'. Take a look at the incorrect sentences and how to fix them:


Are you guy tired? (X)
* Are you guys tired? (✓)


I'll pick you guy up. (X)
* I'll pick you guys up. (✓)


Try listening to the correct sentences and repeating after the audio, making sure you enunciate the -s sound.


PHRASES & VERBS


LET’S SEE


IT’S MY TREAT
It’s my treat = (เลี้ยง)
* Let’s get coffee. Don’t worry, it’s my treat.
* Since you’re visiting, the tickets are my treat.


WOW


CULTURE NOTE


'Y’ALL' AS A GENDER-NEUTRAL PHRASE


While 'you guys' is widely used to address groups, some argue that it carries a gender bias. They suggest using a gender-neutral alternative, like 'you all.' In the southern US, 'y'all' is a common colloquialism, which is a contraction of 'you all.' It’s also become popular to use by young people.


Although 'you all' is considered more politically correct, 'you guys' remains prevalent in informal speech, even when addressing groups of women.


PRACTICE


PRACTICE 'YOU GUYS'


Change the subject in these sentences to 'you guys.'

LESSON FOCUS


How to make questions with 'Do...?' and 'Does...?’


Verb tense: Present simple tense


In Lesson 2.4, you learned how to ask simple questions to get to know someone, such as 'Do you like tacos?' or 'Do you have siblings?' In this lesson, you’ll learn how to ask any question in present simple tense using 'Do...?' or 'Does...?'


________________




DO...?


In the conversation, Chloe asks Pailin about Anthony and his sister:


* Do they talk often?


The question is made by adding ‘Do’ to the beginning of the present simple tense sentence ‘They talk often.’ So, ‘Do’ changes a statement into a yes/no question.


Here are more examples:


* Do I speak English well?
* Do we have homework?
* Do your parents live in England?


Keep in mind that ‘Do’ is used for these subjects: I, you, we, they, 2+ nouns


________________




DOES...?


Compare these two questions from the conversation:


* Do they talk often?
* Does he come to LA often?


Notice how the first word changed in the question from 'Do' to 'Does.' This is because the subject is different. When making questions with the subjects 'he · she · it · noun,' the question must begin with 'Does.'


Now take a look at the main verb that's underlined in these two lines:


* His sister lives in LA.
* Does he drive a motorcycle?


In the first sentence, -s is added to the end of verb because it follows ‘he · she · it · noun.’ What do you notice about the second line? The verb doesn’t have an -s even though the subject is ‘he’. Instead, the questioning auxiliary verb ‘Do’ takes the -s to become ‘Does,’ while the main verb ‘drive’ stays in its base form.


You might remember that the same rule applies to negative present simple tense sentences:


* He drives a motorcycle.
* He doesn’t drive a motorcycle.


The negative auxiliary verb ‘does not’ takes the -s, while the main verb ‘drive’ stays in its base form.


________________




USES & STRUCTURE


Recall that present simple tense is used when talking about routines, habits, feelings, and general knowledge, like facts and widely accepted truths. In the same way, questions in present simple tense are used to ask about things that happen regularly, or for asking about how someone feels.


Here is a breakdown of forming questions using present simple tense.

EXTRA TIPS


SHORT FORM ANSWERS


Remember that yes/no questions can be answered with a simple ‘Yeah’ or ‘No,’ but sometimes a short form answer is given to maintain the flow of conversation. To answer ‘Do…?’ and 'Does...?' questions, you should use either the words 'do · don't' or 'does · doesn't' in your answers, NOT the main verb.


* Luke: Do your parents live in Thailand?
Pailin: Yeah, they do.


* Pailin: Do you have a brother?
Luke: No, I don't.


* Luke: Does Anthony live in San Francisco?
Pailin: Yeah, he does.


* Luke: Does she like cats?
Pailin: No, she doesn't.


COMMON MISTAKES


MISTAKE #1


Thai people often answer these yes/no questions in the following incorrect way:


A: Does she speak English?
B: Yes, she speak. (X)


A: Do they eat meat?
B: Yes, they eat. (X)


A: Does he want kids?
B: No, he not want. (X)


They incorrectly respond with the main verb of the sentence. This is because that’s how the sentence would be answered in Thai, for example:


A: แม่คุณเล่นเทนนิสไหมคะ
B: เล่นครับ


Remember that the auxiliary verbs ‘do · don't' or 'does · doesn't’ should be used in these answers, NOT the main verb.


* A: Does she speak English?
B: Yes, she does. (✓)


* A: Do they eat meat?
B: Yes, they do. (✓)


* A: Does he want kids?
B: No, he doesn't. (✓)




________________




MISTAKE #2


It’s common for Thai people to omit the question words ‘do’ or 'does' and simply ask:


They drink coffee? (X)
She live in Japan? (X)


Although you can ask questions in this way (see Lesson 2.10), remember that this style of question is mainly used to confirm something you already suspect to be true. For general questions, it's important to begin your questions with 'Do' or 'Does,' so they become:


* Do they drink coffee? (✓)
* Does she live in Japan? (✓)

You've learned to add -s to verbs that follow 'he · she · it · noun,’ for example:


* He works at a gas station.
* She lives in Los Angeles.
* It looks good.


 But the verb 'have' follows a slightly different pattern. Compare these two lines from the conversation:


* They have a lot of fun classes.
* Emily has a yoga mat.


Notice that 'have' doesn't become 'haves' when it follows the subject 'Emily.' Instead, it becomes the word 'has.' The words 'have' and 'has' are used frequently in English, so it's important to remember this rule.


Here are more sentences with 'has' from the conversation:


* It has a nice pool.
* The gym down the street has a huge pool.


Remember that in questions and negative sentences, the main verb 'have' would not be conjugated, but rather the auxiliary verb 'do' gets conjugated to become 'does.'


Negative Sentences:
* They don't have a pool.
* It doesn't have a pool.


Questions:
* Do they have yoga classes?
* Does the gym have yoga classes?
COMMON MISTAKES


SHORT FORM ANSWERS


When asking present simple tense questions with the main verb 'have,' the short form answer should use the words 'do · don't' or 'does · doesn't,' NOT the verb 'have · has.'


For example, in the conversation, when Pailin asks if the gym down the street has yoga classes, Luke responds with:


* Yeah, they do!


He does NOT say 'Yeah, they have' or 'Yes, have.'


See the incorrect responses below, and how to fix them.


* Luke: Do you have any siblings?
Pailin: Yeah, I do. (✓)
Pailin: Yeah, I have. (X)
Pailin: Yeah, have. (X)


* Pailin: Do they have sunglasses?
Luke: No, they don't. (✓)
Luke: No, they not have. (X)


* Luke: Does she have any roommates?
Pailin: Yeah, she does. (✓)
Pailin: Yeah, she have. (X)


* Luke: Does your dad have an accent?
Pailin: No, he doesn't. (✓)
Pailin: No, he not have. (X)

LESSON FOCUS


An overview of 3rd person verb conjugation


So far, you've learned that the subjects 'he · she · it · noun' are followed by verbs conjugated differently from the subjects 'I · you · we · they · 2+ nouns.' This lesson provides an overview of all the conjugations you have learned.


________________




-S CONJUGATIONS


There is a simple rule you can remember for verbs that follow 'he · she · it · noun':


These verbs often end with -s.


You’ll see this pattern more clearly as you go through this lesson.


________________




IS & WAS


Take a look at these lines from the conversation:


* My dad is a lawyer.
* My mom's family is from France.
* My mom is a nurse.
* He was a personal trainer for celebrities in Thailand.


The to-be verbs 'is' and 'was' both end in -s, since the subject is 'he · she · it · noun.' Compare the above sentences to those below, where the verb doesn't have an -s ending:


* They are lawyers.
* We are from France.
* I am a nurse.
* You were a personal trainer for celebrities in Thailand.


________________




PRESENT SIMPLE TENSE VERBS


Take a look at these lines from the conversation:


* My mom has a wine business.
* She knows a lot about wine.
* She has a glass of wine every night.
* My dad only drinks on holidays.
* My dad manages a gym.
* Yeah, he does.


These verbs have -s at the end, since the subject is 'he · she · it · noun.' Remember that 'have' becomes 'has', not 'haves.' Also remember that 'do' becomes 'does', not 'dos.' Compare the above sentences to those below, where the verb doesn't have an -s ending:


* They have a wine business.
* I know a lot about wine.
* We have a glass of wine every night.
* You only drink on holidays.
* They manage a gym.
* Yeah, we do.


________________




NEGATIVE VERBS & QUESTIONS


Take a look at this line from the conversation:


* My mom doesn't drink alcohol.


Remember that 'do not' becomes 'does not,' which still follows the rule of having an -s ending - it’s just that the auxiliary verb ‘do not’ takes the -s to become ‘does not.’ This goes for questions, too, where the question word ‘Do’ takes the -s to become ‘Does’:


* Does your dad work out often?


Compare the above sentences to those below, where neither the main verb nor the auxiliary verb ‘do’ has an -s ending:


* They don't drink alcohol.
* Do you work out often?


Whew! That was a lot. Now you see how common it is to have -s endings for verbs with the subjects 'he · she · it · noun.' Remember to practice pronouncing that -s sound, and you'll get the hang of it!


COMMON MISTAKES


ADDING ‘S


It's totally understandable that 3rd person verb conjugation can be challenging for ESL learners, as adding an -s doesn't change the sentence's core meaning. However, applying the -s ending is a key step towards making your English sound more natural! See the incorrect sentences below and how to fix them with an -s ending:


She are at school. (X)
She at school. (X)
* She's at school. (✓)


He were a good student. (X)
* He was a good student. (✓)

* She doesn't like spicy food. (✓)

* Does Jake drive a car? (✓)


PHRASES & VERBS


What do you do? = (the common way to ask what someone’s job is)
* So, what do you do in Thailand?

How to talk about the future with 'will'
Verb tense: Future simple tense


________________




FUTURE SIMPLE TENSE


Future simple tense is used to talk about actions or events that will happen in the future. In the conversation, Pailin and Chloe use this tense to plan their trip to the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Amoeba Music:


* My host mom will drop me off.
* I'll get some vinyls for my parents.
* I'll bring my camera.
* It'll be fun!


Are they at the Hollywood Walk of Fame right now? Nope! They will go there later, after 1PM. Unlike present simple tense (used for routines and current feelings) and present continuous tense (used for things happening right now), future simple tense is used for events that haven’t happened yet.


________________




USES OF FUTURE SIMPLE TENSE FOR AFFIRMATIVE SENTENCES


More specifically, affirmative future simple tense sentences are used for:


1. Intentions or plans made for the future:
* I'll finish the report by Friday.


2. Decisions made at the moment of speaking:
* *doorbell rings* I'll get it!


3. Predictions for things you believe will happen:
* It'll rain tomorrow.


4. Promises you will commit to doing:
* I'll help you with your job application when I finish work.


5. Offers to help someone:
* Those bags look heavy. I'll carry them for you.


Take a look at what the affirmative sentences from the conversation demonstrate:


* I'll run some errands first.
An intention or plan


* I'll ask her to pick you up.
An offer or promise


* I'll get some vinyls for my parents.
A plan or intention


* They'll love that.
A prediction


* I'll bring my camera.
A decision made at the moment of speaking


* It'll be fun!
A prediction


* I'll text you when we leave the house.
A promise


________________




AFFIRMATIVE SENTENCE STRUCTURE


In these three sentences, take a look at the main verb:


* I'll get some vinyls for my parents.
* I'll bring my camera.
* I'll text you when we leave the house.


Notice that 'I'll' comes before each verb:


I'll = I will


The full sentences are:


I will get some vinyls for my parents.
I will bring my camera.
I will text you when we leave the house.


The word 'will' is an auxiliary verb that indicates you are speaking about the future. However, you should contract the subject with 'will' when speaking, as 'I'll' is easier and quicker to say than 'I will.'


Now take a look at this line that also uses future simple tense:


My host mom will drop me off.


Although 'my host mom' is a 3rd person subject, neither the auxiliary verb 'will' nor the main verb 'drop' has an -s ending! Lucky for you, the grammar of future simple tense sentences is straightforward. The sentence structure is the same for all subjects!


Here is the structure of affirmative future simple tense sentences. Note that you can contract pronouns with 'will,' but you can't do this with subjects like 'My host mom' or 'The store.'




SUBJECT
	AUXILIARY VERB
	VERB
	EXAMPLE SENTENCES
	I
You
We
They
2+ Nouns
He

* You'll like the movie tonight.
* We'll have a meeting tomorrow.
* They'll arrive at 5PM.
* My kids will have tennis lessons tonight.
* He'll finish the project by Friday.
* She'll call you later today.
* It'll rain soon.
* The train will leave at midnight.


________________




NEGATIVE SENTENCE STRUCTURE AND USES


In the conversation, Pailin says:


* I won't be free until 1PM.
won't = will not


Pailin says that she will not be available until 1PM, a time in the future. So, she uses 'will not' in her sentence. Note that 'will not' becomes 'won't' when contracted, not 'willn't.'


Negative sentences in future simple tense are mostly used for:


1. Predictions for things you expect will not happen in the future:
* They won't win the game.


2. Refusals for things you are unwilling to do:
* I won't go to the party if you don't go.


3. Promises for things you will refrain from doing:
* I won't tell anyone your secret.


4. Showing a future absence, closure, or unavailability:
* The store won't be open tomorrow, since it's a holiday.


Pailin's line 'I won't be free until 1PM' is an example of future unavailability.


Here is the structure of negative future simple tense sentences.

* She won't lend me money.
* It won't snow tomorrow.
* The bus won't arrive on time.

QUESTION STRUCTURE AND USES


In the conversation, Pailin asks Chloe:


* Will you take the metro to the Walk of Fame?


Compare this to the affirmative sentence:


* You will take the metro to the Walk of Fame.


To form questions in future simple tense, simply switch the position of the subject and the auxiliary verb 'will.'


Questions in future simple tense are mostly used for:


1. Requests to politely ask someone to do something in the future:
* Will you help me organize the closet after dinner?


2. Asking about future plans, intentions, or events:
* Will you take the bus to work?


3. Asking about future predictions and outcomes:
* Will it rain tomorrow?


Pailin's question 'Will you take the metro to the Walk of Fame?' is an example of asking about Chloe's future plans.


Here is the structure of future simple tense questions.

* Will he finish the report on time?
* Will she call me later?
* Will it be sunny tomorrow?
* Will the store be open on Sunday?




EXTRA TIPS


SHORT FORM ANSWERS


Remember that yes/no questions can be answered with a simple ‘Yeah’ or ‘No,’ but sometimes a short form answer is given to maintain the flow of conversation. To answer ‘Will...?' questions, you should use either the words 'will' or 'won't' in your answers, NOT the main verb. Note that you shouldn't contract the subject with 'will' in these answers - it sounds awkward to say 'Yes, I'll,' so remember to stick with 'Yes, I will.'


In the conversation, notice how Chloe answers Pailin's question:


* Pailin: Will you take the metro to the Walk of Fame?
Chloe: No, I won't.


Here are more examples:


* Luke: Will the library be open tomorrow?
Pailin: Yeah, it will.


* Pailin: Will you help me cook dinner tonight?
Luke: Yeah, I will.


* Pailin: Will Alex take that job offer?
Luke: No, he won't.


COMMON MISTAKES


WILL CONTRACTION


Thai people often forget to contract the subject with 'will' in affirmative sentences. There is nothing wrong with this, but your speech will sound more natural by using contractions. For example:


I will go to the store after work.
This is fine to say, but it sounds better as:
* I'll go to the store after work. (✓)


We will be late if we take the train.
This is fine to say, but it sounds better as:
* We'll be late if we take the train. (✓)




PHRASES & VERBS


RUN ERRANDS
Run errands = (to go out and do small tasks on your to-do list)
* I’m exhausted. I’ve been running errands all morning.
* I’ll be back in about 2 hours. I’ve gotta run some errands.

        DROP OFF
Drop off (someone or something) / Drop (someone or something) off = (to take someone or something to a particular place and leave them there)
* I’ll drop off the kids at soccer practice on my way to work.
* Could you drop these letters off at the post office for me?

        PICK UP
Pick up (someone or something) / Pick (someone or something) up = (to go somewhere to collect a person or a thing)
* I have to pick my daughter up from daycare by 6PM.
* I’ll be leaving the airport soon. I’m just waiting to pick up my suitcase.

        PERFECT
Perfect = (said when everything works out well)
* Pailin: I’m off work at 5. How about you?
Luke: Perfect, I’m off at 5, too. Let’s meet at the subway station at 5:30.


* Luke: How about I bring the pasta, and you bring the wine.
Pailin: That’s perfect. I’ll be at your place at 6 then.

How to say goodbye


________________




BYE!


There are several ways to say goodbye to someone. In the conversation, when Chloe and Pailin are parting ways, Chloe says:


* Bye!


You can say this to anyone - friends, family, co-workers, and acquaintances. It’s a shortened version of ‘goodbye,’ which you can also say, but it can sound stiff and robotic. You can also end a phone conversation with ‘Bye!’


________________




SEE YOU!


Pailin and Chloe also exchange these phrases:


* See you!
* See you in the morning!


‘See you!’ is a friendly and casual way to say goodbye. It implies that you expect to see the other person again in the near future, like within the next week. So you could say it to your co-workers, since you see them throughout the week, but you wouldn’t say it to a client who you meet with once a year.


You can add a time phrase at the end, as Pailin does in ‘See you in the morning!’ If you know when you’ll see the person again, you could use that time phrase, such as:


* See you later!
* See you tonight!
* See you tomorrow!
* See you on Friday!


________________




HAVE A GOOD NIGHT!


Chloe says to Pailin:


* Have a good night!


This is a polite way to wish that someone will enjoy the rest of their night. If it’s still daytime, you could say:


* Have a good day!


Both phrases are often used by service workers, such as cashiers, servers, or baristas, when a customer is leaving.


________________




GOOD NIGHT!


Lastly, Pailin ends the conversation with:


* Good night!


Although this is usually said right before going to sleep in your home, you can also say it to others when parting ways at night.


As you can see, there are several closing phrases for saying goodbye to someone. You don’t need to use every phrase, but saying one or some of them helps to end a conversation naturally and avoid an abrupt ending.



EXTRA TIPS


TAKE CARE!


'Take care!' is a useful phrase when saying goodbye, especially when you're uncertain when you'll see the other person again. This is what you could say to a client who you meet with only once a year, or you could say it to a family member who you don't see very often. It expresses the hope that they'll be safe and healthy until the next time you see them.


* Take care!




PHRASES & VERBS


WOW


I KNOW
I know = (can be said to agree with what someone says)
* Pailin: That movie was so good!
Luke: I know! The acting was incredible.


* Pailin: I hate this gloomy weather.
Luke: I know, it makes me depressed.
