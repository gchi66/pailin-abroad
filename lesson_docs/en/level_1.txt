How to greet someone


BACKSTORY


Pailin is a 21-year-old girl from Thailand who will be studying abroad at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) for one year. She’ll be staying with a host family who she hasn’t met yet. She’s at her study-abroad program’s orientation in Los Angeles, and she’s meeting her student advisor for the first time.




CONVERSATION


Advisor: Hi, I’m Frank. I’m your student advisor.
Pailin: Hi, Frank. I’m Pailin.

UNDERSTAND


LESSON FOCUS


How to greet people


In the conversation, Frank says to Pailin:


* Hi


This is a standard and friendly way to greet anyone - strangers, acquaintances, friends, and family. Notice that Pailin also responds with ‘Hi’ to Frank. ‘Hi’ is said in both casual and formal settings.


Another casual and friendly way to greet people is:


* Hey


This works with family, friends, and acquaintances, but is very casual and shouldn’t be used in formal settings.


You’ve likely learned to use this greeting:


* Hello


This can also be used to greet anyone, although it’s most natural to say it to strangers. It sounds a bit formal and polite, so it isn’t used as often in everyday conversation, especially with friends and family.


The three greetings above can be said at any time of day. If you’re unsure which greeting to use, it’s best to stick with ‘Hi’ as it’s the most appropriate greeting for any circumstance.


CULTURE NOTE


​​GREETINGS IN THE US


While the Thai 'wai' is a standard greeting in Thailand, common greetings in the US usually involve physical touch, either with a handshake or a hug.


Shaking hands is the most common way to greet someone you're meeting for the first time. It creates a polite and sometimes professional connection. Just as foreigners should practice how to 'wai' when visiting Thailand, you should practice your handshake - it should be firm, but not too strong. Shaking hands is common in these settings:


- At work or professional settings
- Introducing yourself to a stranger, like a neighbor
- Meeting a friend of a friend for the first time, regardless of gender


Hugging has become a common greeting that shows warmth, friendliness, and a more personal connection than a handshake. Deciding whether to hug someone or give them a handshake often depends on the relationship and context:


- Casual first meetings. For women meeting a new acquaintance (especially another woman) in a casual setting, a light hug is common. When a woman casually meets a new acquaintance who's a man, either a handshake OR a hug might be appropriate
- With friends. Hugging is very common among friends, particularly women, even if they see each other often
- Family: Hugs are the standard greeting for family members, including aunts, uncles, and grandparents


There is one more greeting: the 'bro hug.' Men sometimes greet each other with a casual 'bro hug,' which is more personable than a formal handshake. The 'bro hug' starts with a handshake, then becomes a brief pat on the back or hug with the left hand. This is common for:


- A man meeting a male friend of a friend for the first time
- Guy friends greeting each other
- Note: Women typically don't do this with each other or with men. You should also avoid doing the 'bro hug' in professional settings


American greetings usually involve physical touch. If you're uncomfortable with this, you can simply wave and say 'Hi' when meeting someone for the first time.

How to introduce yourself


BACKSTORY
Pailin is a 21-year-old girl from Thailand who will be studying abroad at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) for one year. She’s at her orientation, where new students can meet and get to know each other. She starts talking to another student.

How to introduce yourself


In the conversation, a girl at Pailin’s student orientation asks her:

* What’s your name?
What’s = What is


This is the typical way to ask for someone’s name.


Pailin responds with:


* I’m Pailin.


This is the typical way to respond, although she could have also responded simply with:


* Pailin.


        Or she could have given a longer answer:


* My name is Pailin.


        Notice she adds the question ‘and you?’ to return the question to Chloe.


EXTRA TIPS


WHAT’S YOUR NAME AGAIN?


Do you forget people’s names easily? Here’s how you can ask for someone’s name again when they’ve already introduced themselves to you:


* Sorry, what’s your name again?


The word ‘again’ at the end of the sentence acknowledges that you’ve already asked for their name, but you’ve forgotten it.


CULTURE NOTE


NICKNAMES


Most Thais have an official first and last name, as well as a short nickname used in everyday life. These Thai nicknames are often distinct and unrelated to a person’s official first name. But while first and last names are standard in English-speaking countries, nicknames are less common and are usually shortened versions of a first name.


Here are some examples of common English nicknames:
Amanda → Mandy
Elizabeth → Liz
Jillian → Jill
Penelope → Penny
Christopher → Chris
Daniel → Danny
Jeffrey → Jeff
Joseph → Joey, Joe
Thomas → Tom




Since not everyone has or uses a nickname, it's best to refer to someone by the name they use when introducing themselves.

In response, you can say:


* It’s nice to meet you too.
* Nice to meet you too.

BACKSTORY
Pailin is a 21-year-old girl from Thailand who will be studying abroad at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) for one year. She’s at her orientation, where new students can meet and get to know each other.


CONVERSATION


Pailin: Hi, I’m Pailin. What’s your name?
Student: I’m Kevin, nice to meet you.

A. He’s good.
B. He’s okay.
C. He’s great.
D. He’s fine.


Answer key: C

In the conversation, Pailin asks Kevin, ‘How are you?’ Imagine someone just asked you this. How can you respond? Tip: Try not to use the word ‘fine.’
UNDERSTAND


LESSON FOCUS


How to ask how someone is doing


In the conversation, Kevin asks Pailin:

* How are you?


This is a common and friendly greeting question for any context, whether casual or professional. While it is a question, it’s more of a social formality that’s used to begin a conversation.


Pailin responds to Kevin’s question with:


* I’m great, thanks, and you?


This is a standard response. Notice that it’s very brief and positive, and she doesn’t go into detail of how she’s actually feeling. Even if she isn’t feeling great, she keeps the response positive and light. Other typical responses include:


* I’m good.
Can be shortened to ‘Good!’


* I’m great.
Can be shortened to ‘Great!’


* I’m alright.
Can be shortened to ‘Alright.’


Do you notice a response that’s not shown above? ‘I’m fine.’ While this is a perfectly good response, it sounds less friendly and natural than the ones above.


Pailin adds ‘thanks’ to her sentence for added politeness. It’s like saying ‘Thanks for asking.’


Lastly, she finishes with ‘and you?’ to return the question back to Kevin.


Here’s another example of this kind of exchange:


* Pailin: How are you?
Kevin: Good! And you?
Pailin: Great, thanks.




EXTRA TIPS


ALTERNATIVE PHRASES


There are several ways to ask ‘How are you?’ in English. Some common examples and their appropriate responses are listed below:


* How’s it going?
You can say this to anyone in any context. Restaurant and store employees will often say this to customers. It sounds relaxed, casual, and friendly.


* Store Clerk: How’s it going?
Pailin: Good!
*‘Well!’ is the correct response grammatically, but in casual spoken English, most people respond with ‘Good!’


* How’ve you been?
You can say this to friends or acquaintances you haven’t seen in a while.


* Chai: How’ve you been?
Pailin: I’ve been great!


* How’s everything?
You can also say this to friends or acquaintances you haven’t seen in a while.


* Lek: How’s everything?
Pailin: Everything is good!


* What’s up?
This is very casual and should only be said to friends you see on a regular basis. Notice the standard response of ‘Good!’ or ‘Great!’ can’t be used to answer this question.


* Pailin: What’s up?
Pete: Not much.


COMMON MISTAKES


MISTAKE #1


Try to avoid responding to ‘How are you?’ with ‘I’m fine, thank you, and you?’ You probably learned this response in English class at school, but it can sound robotic and unnatural in casual conversation.
CULTURE NOTE


HAVE YOU EATEN?


‘How are you?’ is similar to asking ‘Have you eaten?’ in Thailand. It’s more of a greeting than a serious question. If an acquaintance asks you ‘How are you?’ you should answer with something positive, even if you’ve had a bad day, such as one of these responses:


* Good, thanks.
* I’m okay.


But if a close friend or family member asks how you’re doing, you can of course give a more in-depth answer, whether your day was great or bad. See the example conversations below:


* Pailin: How are you?
Dara: Not too good, I just got fired from my job.
Pailin: Oh, I’m sorry to hear that!

* Chloe: How are you?
Pailin: A bit tired. I didn’t sleep well. How about you?
Chloe: I’m good, thanks.

        FRIENDLY EMPLOYEES


In Thailand, it’s not typical for store or restaurant staff to ask customers สบายดีไหมครับ or เป็นยังไงบ้างครับ. These questions roughly translate to ‘How are you?’ and are usually said between people who know each other or are meeting on a personal level. But in the US, it’s very common for employees to greet customers with ‘How are you?’ or similar phrases. You may have noticed foreign travelers in Thailand sometimes ask สบายดีไหมครับ to servers. This is because it’s the cultural norm to have this type of interaction with employees.

How to use greeting phrases


In the conversation, Pailin says to her new friend Joey:

   * Good morning!


Joey responds with a simple:


   * Morning!


These greetings are common in the morning, typically until around 10AM or 11AM. They can be said to anyone - family, neighbors, friends, co-workers, and service staff, like a barista or cashier. Of course, ‘Hi’ or ‘Hey’ are also perfectly acceptable greetings in the morning.


You may have learned these four greeting phrases already:


   * Good morning
   * Good afternoon
   * Good evening
   * Good night


‘Good morning’ and ‘good night’ are the most frequently used in everyday conversation. ‘Good afternoon’ and ‘Good evening’ sound quite formal and are hardly used in casual settings. You’re more likely to hear them in formal situations, like with a server greeting customers, hotel staff greeting a guest, or a speaker addressing an audience.

________________




STRUCTURE OF ‘AM’


When Frank asks Pailin and Chloe if they’re excited to meet their host families, Pailin says:


   * I’m so nervous!


She is describing how she feels right now. Chloe also describes her feelings:


   * I’m nervous, but I’m excited!


Notice that they both use ‘I’m’ in their sentences.


I’m = I am


The phrase ‘I am’ is said so often in English that it’s almost always shortened to ‘I’m.’ The verb ‘am’ is called a ‘to-be’ verb, and it is one of three to-be verbs. They are:


am · are · is


You will learn about the to-be verbs ‘are’ and ‘is’ in future lessons. This lesson focuses on ‘am.’


‘Am’ is ONLY used after the subject ‘I,’ as in ‘I am’ or more commonly ‘I’m.’


________________




        USES OF ‘AM’


There are three basic ways to use ‘I’m’ in a sentence:


1. I’m (adjective).
‘Adjectives’ are words that describe nouns.
Examples: funny, tall, smart, sick


2. I’m (prepositional phrase).
A ‘prepositional phrase’ begins with a preposition word, such as ‘in · at · on · near,’ followed by a place. It describes your relationship to a location.
Examples: in school, at work, on the train, near the bank


3. I’m (noun OR noun phrase).
A ‘noun’ is a person, place, thing, or idea. A ‘noun phrase’ is an ‘adjective + noun.’
Examples: a doctor, an engineer, a good friend, a fast learner


Click here to learn more about adjectives, prepositions, nouns, and other parts of speech.


The lines from the conversation demonstrate ‘I’m (adjective)’ because the words ‘nervous’ and ‘excited’ are adjectives. It’s important to note that ‘I’m’ indicates the present state you are in (right now), not the past or future. This will make more sense as you progress through the levels.


________________




EXAMPLE SENTENCES


Now that you understand the usage and structure of ‘am’ in a sentence, take a look at these example sentences. Notice the contracted version ‘I’m’ is always used:


   1. I’m (adjective).
   * I’m hungry.
   * I’m sleepy.
   * I’m smart.
   * I’m Thai.

      2. I’m (prepositional phrase).
      * I’m at the market.
      * I’m in New York.
      * I’m from Thailand.
      * I’m by the river.


      3. I’m (noun OR noun phrase).
      * I’m a lawyer.
      * I’m a good cook.
      * I’m a quiet person.
      * I’m a student.

THAI TO-BE VERBS


Thai also has three to-be verbs:


เป็น · คือ · อยู่


But while the Thai to-be verbs are used in different contexts, English to-be verbs are used in the same contexts but with different subjects. This will become clearer in later lessons.


COMMON MISTAKES


MISTAKE #1


Thai people often omit the word ‘am’ in a sentence, for example ‘I tired’ or ‘I hungry.’ This is likely because they are translating a sentence directly from Thai to English. Take a look at these two sentences in Thai from the conversation:


ฉันกังวล
ฉันตื่นเต้น


There is no verb in these sentences. When translated into English word for word, they become:


ฉันกังวล
I nervous. (X)

ฉันตื่นเต้น
I excited. (X)


These are incorrect because they don’t have a verb. In English, every sentence must have a verb. The sentences above must be:


      * I’m nervous. (✓)
      * I’m excited. (✓)


________________




        MISTAKE #2


Another common error is leaving out the subject of a sentence. This is because in Thai, the subject of a sentence is usually omitted when it’s clear from the context who the subject is. For example:


หิวค่ะ


Translated directly, this would just be ‘Hungry.’ The sentence makes sense in Thai because the subject is understood from the context. But in English, every sentence must have a subject AND a verb! So the sentence above must be:


      * I’m hungry.


Remember to always use the word ‘I’ when talking about yourself.




________________




MISTAKE #3


In this conversation, you saw two adjectives - ‘excited’ and ‘nervous’ - which learners sometimes confuse.


‘Excited’ means you feel a lot of energy, but in a happy or positive way. For example:


      * I’m excited to go to Disneyland!


‘Nervous’ also means you have a lot of energy, but it’s a more negative feeling of worry or unease. For example:


      * I’m nervous about meeting my boyfriend’s parents.

BACKSTORY


Pailin is at her orientation in Los Angeles for her study-abroad program. She is talking with Chloe, a girl in her program who she just met.




CONVERSATION

How to ask someone’s age


In the conversation, Chloe asks Pailin:

      * How old are you?


This is the typical way to ask what someone’s age is. Take a look at how Pailin and Chloe tell each other their ages:


      * I’m 21.
      * I’m 23.


They use this structure:


I’m (number).


The full way to reply is:


I’m (number) years old.
      * I’m 34 years old.


But in casual conversation, you can leave out ‘years old’ for simplicity. Saying ‘I’m 27’ sounds more natural than saying the full sentence ‘I’m 27 years old.’


PHRASES & VERBS


Oh! = (said when you are pleasantly surprised about something)
      * Pailin: I baked this cake for you.
Luke: Oh, it looks so good! Thank you!

CULTURE NOTES


AGE & RESPECT


Age plays a significant role in Thai culture, as it affects how you talk to someone and how polite you should be. In many Asian cultures, respect is often automatically given to elders. However, in many Western cultures like the US, elders are not automatically shown respect simply because they are older. Respect is usually earned through actions, personality, or position.


Also important to note is that asking someone’s age, especially upon first meeting, can be considered impolite or sometimes even rude to ask. This is because age can be a sensitive topic, and some people prefer not to discuss it. It’s more appropriate to ask about age when you’ve gotten to know someone better, they appear to be close to your age, or the topic comes up naturally in conversation.

There is even a saying in English, ‘Never ask a woman about her age.’ Even if your intentions are pure, asking a woman her age can get you in trouble. They might assume that they look old and that’s why you’re asking, so it’s best to avoid asking unless they bring it up.

UNDERSTAND


LESSON FOCUS


How to thank someone


In the conversation, when Pailin compliments Chloe’s bracelet, Chloe says:

      * Thank you!


This is perhaps the most important phrase you should know in English. You can say it to anyone and in all contexts.


There are variations of ‘Thank you’ which range from casual to deep appreciation, listed below:


      * Thanks!
A casual way to show appreciation.


      * Thanks so much!
A more heartfelt way to say thank you.


      * Thank you so much!
A strong way to show deep appreciation. Notice Pailin says this when Chloe gives her the bracelet.


After Pailin thanks Chloe for the bracelet, Chloe responds with:


      * You’re welcome!
(Means ‘You are welcome’)


This is the most standard polite response to ‘Thank you’ in both informal and formal settings. Here are more casual ways to respond:


      * No problem!
A casual response indicating it wasn’t a big deal.


      * No worries!
A friendly, informal response.


      * Anytime.
A relaxed way of showing you’re happy to help again.


      * Of course!
A casual and positive response showing your willingness to help.


The above responses to ‘Thank you’ are appropriate for when you help someone or give them something. But if someone says 'thank you' after you give them a compliment, the only suitable response would be ‘You’re welcome!’ or ‘Of course!’


EXTRA TIPS


GIVING THANKS FOR SPECIFIC REASONS


Here are two ways to give thanks for specific reasons:


        Thank you for (noun).
      * Thank you for the gift.
      * Thanks for your help.
      * Thank you so much for the bracelet. (Pailin could have said this to Chloe)


                Thank you for (verb-ing).
      * Thank you for coming.
      * Thanks for driving me to the airport.
      * Thanks so much for helping me.

How to use the to-be verb ‘are’


You’ve already learned about the to-be verb ‘am’ in Lesson 1.6. Now you’ll learn about the second to-be verb, ‘are.’


________________




USES OF ‘ARE’


Take a look at these sentences from the conversation:


         * These pancakes are so good!
         * You’re a great cook.
         * You’re so kind.
         * They’re blueberry pancakes.
         * The chocolate pancakes are on that table.


All of these sentences use ‘are.’ You may not notice this at first because ‘are’ is often contracted with the subject. For example:


You’re a great cook. = You are a great cook.
They’re blueberry pancakes. = They are blueberry pancakes.


Do you remember the three ways that ‘am’ is used? ‘Are’ is used in the same three ways:


         1. are (adjective)
‘Adjectives’ are words that describe nouns.
Examples: big, green, sad, loud


         2. are (prepositional phrase)
A ‘prepositional phrase’ begins with a preposition word, such as ‘in · at · on · near,’ followed by a place. It describes your relationship to a location.
Examples: in the car, at work, on the table, near the river


         3. are (noun OR noun phrase).
A ‘noun’ is a person, place, thing, or idea. A ‘noun phrase’ is an ‘adjective + noun.’
Examples: doctors, books, a good friend, a tall woman

Try to identify how ‘are’ is used in the conversation. They’re shown below:


These pancakes are so good! (adjective)
You’re a great cook. (noun phrase)
You’re so kind. (adjective)
They’re blueberry pancakes. (noun phrase)
The chocolate pancakes are on that table. (prepositional phrase)




________________




        SUBJECTS WITH ‘ARE’


While ‘am’ can only follow the subject ‘I,’ the verb ‘are’ follows these subjects:


        You are
        We are
        They are
        (2+ nouns) are

‘2+ nouns’ refers to a ‘plural noun.’ This means more than one person or thing. In the conversation, ‘these pancakes’ and ‘The chocolate pancakes’ are examples because they refer to multiple pancakes. Plural nouns will be explored more in Lesson 3.5. For now, a simple way to recognize a plural noun is that it often ends in -s, like ‘pancakes,’ ‘books,’ or ‘dogs.’ You can see more examples of (2+ nouns) in the section below.


Notice that the pronouns ‘we’ and ‘they’ are also plural because they refer to more than one person.


The subject and ‘are’ are usually contracted to form one word.


You are = You’re
We are = We’re
They are = We’re


Note that you can’t contract (2+ nouns) and ‘are.’


My mom and dad’re (X)
My mom and dad are (✓)


________________




EXAMPLE SENTENCES


Now that you understand the usage and structure of ‘are’ in a sentence, take a look at these example sentences. Notice the contractions are used when possible:


         1. are (adjective)
         * You’re cute.
         * We’re tired.
         * Your mom and dad are tall. (this is an example of 2+ nouns)

            2. are (prepositional phrase)
            * We’re at home.
            * They’re on a boat.
            * My kids are at school. (this is an example of 2+ nouns)


            3. are (noun OR noun phrase)
            * You’re an engineer.
            * We’re doctors.
            * Those men are waiters. (this is an example of 2+ nouns)


COMMON MISTAKES


MISTAKE #1


Students often omit the word ‘are’ in a sentence, for example ‘You beautiful’ or ‘They hungry.’ This is likely because they are translating a sentence directly from Thai to English. Take a look at these sentences in Thai from the conversation:


แพนเค้กเหล่านี้อร่อยมาก
คุณใจดีมาก


There are no verbs in these sentences. When translated into English word for word, they become:


        แพนเค้กเหล่านี้อร่อยมาก
        These pancakes so good. (X)


คุณใจดีมาก
You so kind. (X)


These are incorrect because there is no verb. In English, every sentence must have a verb. The sentences above must be:


            * These pancakes are so good. (✓)
            * You’re so kind. (✓)

________________




USES OF ‘IS’


Take a look at these sentences from the conversation:


            * He’s in LA.
            * It’s a good school.
            * He’s very smart.
            * My mom’s a nurse.


All of these sentences use ‘is.’ You may not notice this at first because ‘is’ is usually contracted with the subject. For example:


He’s in LA. = He is in LA.
It’s a good school. = It is a good school.


Do you remember the three ways that ‘am’ and ‘are’ are used? ’Is’ is used in the same three ways:


            1. is (adjective)
‘Adjectives’ are words that describe nouns.
Examples: hot, tired, yellow, heavy


            2. is (prepositional phrase)
A ‘prepositional phrase’ begins with a preposition word, such as ‘in · at · on · near,’ followed by a place. It describes your relationship to a location.
Examples: in the kitchen, at the store, on the desk, near the post office


            3. is (noun OR noun phrase).
A ‘noun’ is a person, place, thing, or idea. A ‘noun phrase’ is an ‘adjective + noun.’
Examples: a nurse, a phone, a talented singer, a brown dog

Try to identify how ‘is’ is used in the conversation. They’re shown below:

It’s a good school. (noun phrase)
He’s very smart. (adjective)
My mom’s a nurse. (noun)


________________




        SUBJECTS WITH ‘IS’


You’ve learned that ‘am’ only follows ‘I’, and ‘are’ follows ‘you · we · they · 2+ nouns.’ The verb ‘is’ follows these subjects:


He is
She is
It is
(Noun) is


‘Noun’ refers to just one noun, called a ‘singular noun.’ In the conversation, ‘my mom’ is an example of this because she is just one person. A singular noun doesn’t have to be a person - it can be an item, such as ‘The key’ or ‘My house.’ Notice that ‘he,’ ‘she,’ and ‘it’ also refer to a single person or thing, so they are ‘singular nouns.’ You can see examples of singular nouns and plural nouns in the Extra Tips section.


The subject and ‘is’ are usually contracted to form one word.


He is = He’s
She is = She’s
It is = It’s
(Noun) is = (Noun)’s


Remember, contractions make a sentence smoother and sound more natural. The line ‘My mom’s a nurse’ flows better than ‘My mom is a nurse.’

            * He’s funny.
            * She’s smart.
            * Joey’s tired. (this is an example of a singular noun)

               2. is (prepositional phrase)
               * It’s in the box.
               * She’s at the post office.
               * My dog’s outside. (this is an example of a singular noun)


               3. is (noun OR noun phrase)
               * He’s a good soccer player.
               * It’s a scary movie.
               * Mark is a lawyer. (this is an example of a singular noun)


EXTRA TIPS


SINGULAR VS. PLURAL NOUNS


Now you’ve learned these rules:


(Noun) is
(2+ nouns) are


Without going in-depth, remember that an easy way to spot a plural noun (2+ nouns) is that it often ends in -s, like ‘pancakes,’ ‘books,’ or ‘dogs.’ Take a look at this line from the conversation:


               * His classes are hard.


The word 'class' has -es added to the end, so the sentence refers to multiple classes. This is why 'are' is used. Compare that with this sentence:


               * His class is hard.


‘Class’ refers to a single class, so ‘is’ is used. ‘Class’ is the singular noun, while ‘classes’ is the plural noun. You will learn more about these in Lesson 3.5.


COMMON MISTAKES


MISTAKE #1


Just as with ‘am’ and ‘are,’ Thai people often omit the word ‘is’ from a sentence. Try to avoid translating sentences from Thai to English, because this can cause important words to be omitted. Take a look at this sentence from the conversation in Thai:


เขาฉลาดมาก


There is no verb in this sentence. When translated into English word for word, it becomes:


        เขาฉลาดมาก
        He very smart. (X)


This is incorrect because there is no verb. As emphasized before, every sentence must have a verb in English. The sentence above must be:


               * He’s very smart. (✓)


PHRASES & VERBS


Nice! = (a positive expression to show enthusiasm or approval)
               * Luke: I applied for a few jobs today.
Chloe: Nice! I’m sure you’ll get one.


               * Luke: I found some nice AirBnBs for our trip to Mexico City.
Pailin: Nice! Send them to me and I’ll take a look at them.




Oh! (pleasant surprise)

How to ask where someone is from


BACKSTORY
Pailin is at an orientation in Los Angeles for her study-abroad program. She’s talking with Chloe, a girl in her program who she just met.


CONVERSATION


Chloe: Pailin, where are you from?
Pailin: I’m from Thailand. How about you?
Chloe: I’m from Thailand too!
Pailin: Really?
Chloe: Yeah. My dad is from Thailand and my mom is from France.

In the conversation, Chloe tells Pailin that she’s from Chiang Mai. Which part of Thailand are you from?
UNDERSTAND


LESSON FOCUS


How to ask where someone is from and how to respond


In the conversation, Chloe asks Pailin:

               * Where are you from?


This is the typical way to ask where someone is from. It’s a useful introductory question.


Take a look at these responses from the conversation:


I’m from (country).
               * I’m from Thailand.


                I’m from (city).
               * I’m from Chiang Mai.


This is not limited to country and city - you can respond with a region or a state, or any geographical location that resonates with the listener. For example:

                I’m from (place).
               * I’m from the north of Thailand.
               * I’m from Isaan.
               * I’m from Texas.
               * I’m from the Bay.


Notice that these responses use ‘I’m (prepositional phrase)’, as the word ‘from’ is a preposition.


COMMON MISTAKES


MISTAKE #1


Thai learners often ask คุณมาจากไหน like this:


        Where you come from? (X)


This is a direct translation from Thai, but it is incorrect in English. Remember the correct way to ask is:


        Where are you from? (✓)


________________




MISTAKE #2


Thai students often incorrectly say ‘I’m from Thai’ instead of ‘I’m from Thailand.’ This is because in Thai language, the country of Thailand is called ประเทศไทย.


Take note of these three things:


        Country: Thailand
               * I’m from Thailand.


        Nationality: Thai
               * I’m Thai.


        Language: Thai
               * I speak Thai.


PHRASES & VERBS


Wow = (used to show surprise or admiration)
               * Wow! This cake is beautiful. Did you make it all by yourself?


        See more uses of ‘Wow’




Cool! = (an informal way of saying ‘That’s great’)
               * Luke: I just got tickets to the concert!
Pailin: Cool! I’m so excited.

               * Pailin: We’re bringing a pie to the potluck.
Luke: Cool, what kind of pie are you bringing?

LESSON FOCUS


How to say ‘This is (something)’


In the conversation, Frank gives different items to Pailin. He hands her something, and she asks him:


                  * What’s this?
What’s = What is


This is a useful question to ask when you want to know what something is.


Take a look at what Frank says as he offers different items to her:


                  * This is your student ID.
                  * This is a welcome bag.
                  * This is a map of the city.


You can follow this structure when explaining what something is:


This is (a noun).


For example:


Pailin walks into a grocery store in the US with her friend and sees an unfamiliar food.
                  * Pailin: What’s this?
Tom: This is cheesecake.


Pailin is at a friend’s house and sees some beautiful fabric.
                  * Pailin: What’s this?
Angie: This is my mom’s favorite scarf. It’s from Japan.


You can also use this sentence structure to introduce someone. In this case, the structure is:


This is (a person).


                  * This is my friend, Chloe.
                  * This is Adam.
                  * This is my mom.


COMMON MISTAKES


MISTAKE #1


It’s common for Thai students to omit the -s sound in ‘What’s’ in the question ‘What’s this?’ Take a look at the fix below:


What this? (X)
                  * What’s this? (✓)


English pronunciation often involves more tongue movement than Thai. This can cause learners to simplify sounds. However, it's beneficial to practice pronouncing all the sounds in each word, especially as a beginner. This helps build strong pronunciation habits. Your tongue might feel a little tired at first, but this practice will pay off in the long run!

How to describe things


Take a look at these sentences from the conversation:


                  * It’s sunny and beautiful.
                  * It’s really dry.
                  * It’s rainy now in Bangkok.
                  * It’s okay.
                  * It’s a bit bland.
                  * It’s so expensive.


These sentences follow a pattern:


It’s (adjective).


This is a very useful sentence structure. You can use it to describe almost anything! Think of different adjectives and practice using them in this structure. The more you practice, the more natural it will become.


Notice that in Thai, this sentence doesn’t have a subject:


แพงมาก


Since every sentence in English must have a subject, ‘It’s’ would be a typical subject for a descriptive sentence like this. So instead of just saying ‘Expensive!’ you must say ‘It’s expensive!’


In the conversation, the structure ‘It’s (adjective)’ is used to discuss the weather, the food, and pricing, but it can be used to describe anything! Take a look at these descriptive sentences below:


                  * It’s late.
                  * It’s difficult.
                  * It’s important.
                  * It’s blue.
                  * It’s nice to meet you.

As mentioned in the previous lesson, it’ll be beneficial to practice pronouncing all the sounds in a word, especially the -s sounds at the end of words. Your tongue might feel a little tired at first, but this practice will pay off in the long run!

How to use ‘not’ in a sentence


So far, you’ve learned how to make affirmative sentences with the to-be verbs ‘am · are · is.’ In this lesson, you’ll learn how to make those sentences negative using the word ‘not.’


________________




NEGATIVE SENTENCES


In the conversation, Pailin says to Frank:

                  * I’m not cold.


While the affirmative sentence would be ‘I’m cold,’ adding ‘not’ changes the sentence into a negative sentence.


‘Not’ is used to negate ALL verbs in English. This lesson will focus on negating simple sentences that use to-be verbs.


Take a look at these sentences from the conversation:


                  * My jacket isn’t blue.
                  * It isn’t there.
                  * It’s not a big deal.
                  * I’m not cold.


In the first two sentences, you can’t see the word ‘not.’ This is because it’s combined with the to-be verb to form a negative contraction:


It isn’t there. = It is not there.


These will be explained more below.

________________




        STRUCTURE


        Notice where the word ‘not’ comes in a sentence. Is it before or after the to-be verb?


My jacket isn’t blue.
My jacket is not blue.


‘Not’ comes after the to-be verb, so it will always follow this pattern:


am not
are not
is not


Remember that contractions are key in English because they help shorten your speech and make it sound natural. There is only one way to contract ‘I am not’:


        I’m not


But there are two ways to contract ‘are not’ and ‘is not’ in a sentence, as you can see from these lines in the conversation:


It isn’t there.
It’s not a big deal.


‘It is not’ can become:


It isn’t
It’s not


‘They are not’ can become either:


They aren’t
They’re not


Both forms are frequently used, so it’s important to know both. Here is a breakdown of ‘are’ and ‘is’ in negative sentences:


TABLE-1:


ARE NOT
	IS NOT
	You’re not = You aren’t
We’re not = We aren’t
They’re not = They aren’t
	He’s not = He isn’t
She’s not = She isn’t
It’s not = It isn’t


Singular noun subjects can also be contracted in both ways:


(Noun)’s not = (Noun) isn’t
My mom’s not = My mom isn’t
Frank’s not = Frank isn’t


But for subjects of 2+ nouns, only one contraction can be used:


(2+ nouns) aren’t
My mom and dad aren’t
The kids aren’t




________________




EXAMPLES


Remember that to-be verbs can come before these three things:


adjectives
prepositional phrases
nouns OR noun phrases


The same applies to negative to-be verbs. Here are examples of negative sentences. Notice that both forms of contractions are used for ‘are not’ and ‘is not.’


        AM NOT
                  * I’m not hungry. (adjective)
                  * I’m not from China. (prepositional phrase)
                  * I’m not a good cook. (noun phrase)


        ARE NOT
                  * You aren’t sick. (adjective)
                  * We’re not at home. (prepositional phrase)
                  * They aren’t fun people. (noun phrase)
                  * Pailin and Chloe aren’t sisters. (noun)


        IS NOT
                  * He isn’t ready. (adjective)
                  * She’s not in the garage. (prepositional phrase)
                  * It isn’t a toy. (noun)
                  * Frank’s not tired. (adjective)
                  * My friend isn’t here. (prepositional phrase)


COMMON MISTAKES


MISTAKE #1


Thai people often omit the to-be verb in negative sentences and only use ‘not’ to make a sentence negative. Take a look at the incorrect sentences below and how to fix them:


        I not thirsty. (X)
                  * I’m not thirsty. (✓)


                We not scared. (X)
                  * We’re not scared. (✓)


                He not at home. (X)
                  * He’s not at home. (✓)

TELLING THE TIME


In the conversation, Frank asks the girls:

                  * What time is it?


This is the typical way to ask for the current time. Pailin responds by saying:


                  * It’s 11:05.


        The sentence structure to tell the time is:


                It’s (time).


        Telling the time is pretty straight-forward, although there are a few things to note.

________________




O’CLOCK


In the conversation, Frank tells the girls:


                  * Please come back at 12:00.


        On the hour, the time can be read as:


                (#) o’clock
                  * 5 o’clock = 5:00


        Often, ‘o’clock’ is omitted. Frank could have also said:


                  * Please come back at 12.


________________




TELLING TIME WITH ‘0’ 12:01 - 12:09


Did you notice how Pailin said the time 11:05? She didn’t say ‘eleven five’ or ‘eleven zero five.’ She said:


                  * 11:05 = eleven-o-five


        The 0 is pronounced as the letter ‘O’ or ‘oh.’

AM & PM


Telling the time in Thai is a bit complex, as the hours of the day are broken down into different intervals. In English, the day is divided into just two sets:


                  * AM = midnight (12:00) to lunchtime (11:59)
                  * PM = lunchtime (12:00) to midnight (11:59)


The hours go from 1 to 12. Frank tells the girls to please come back at 12:00. Would this be referred to as 12AM or 12PM?


It would be 12PM. This time can be referred to as ‘noon.’ Meanwhile, 12AM is often referred to as ‘midnight.’ For example:


                  * Let’s meet at the park at noon.
                  * I always sleep at midnight.


While many countries use military time (a 24-hour clock instead of the 12-hour clock), it’s not often used in the US. You will almost never hear someone refer to 9PM as 21:00 (21 o’clock).

EXTRA TIPS


HALF PAST & QUARTER TIL


You may have learned time phrases such as these:


        It’s quarter past 6. (6:15)
        It’s half past 11. (11:30)
        It’s quarter til 3. (2:45)


While time phrases like these are more widely used in the UK and other English-speaking countries, they’re not used often in the US. It’s more common to simply refer to the times as:


                  * It’s 6:15.
                  * It’s 11:30.
                  * It’s 2:45.


PHRASES & VERBS


Let’s see = (said when you’re trying to remember something or are thinking carefully)
                  * Next Sunday, let’s see, I’ve got to pick up my sister from the airport.
                  * Let’s see, how long did it take to get to Vegas last time?


Come back = (to return)
                  * I want to come back to Thailand next year.
                  * What time did you come back last night?

How to ask questions with to-be verbs


BACKSTORY
Pailin has just finished her last day of student orientation in Los Angeles. She’s chatting with Frank, her student advisor.


CONVERSATION


Frank: Pailin, are you excited for the weekend?
Pailin: Yeah, I am! I'm excited to check out the city. *yawn*
Frank: Are you tired?
Pailin: No, I'm not tired. I'm a little hungry. Is In-N-Out near the hotel?
Frank: Yep, it's down the street.
Pailin: Is it usually busy?
Frank: Yeah, it's always busy. But it's so good!

LESSON FOCUS


How to ask questions with to-be verbs


So far, you’ve learned how to make affirmative and negative sentences using the to-be verbs ‘am · are · is.’ In this lesson, you’ll learn how to make questions with these verbs.


________________




TO-BE VERB QUESTIONS


In the conversation, Frank asks Pailin:

                  * Are you tired?


Compare the question with this related affirmative sentence:


                  * You are tired.


Do you see how the position of the words changed? The subject ‘you’ and the to-be verb ‘are’ swapped places to form a question. All to-be verb questions follow this pattern:


(To-be verb) (subject) (object).


As you might recall, the ‘object’ of the sentence can be one of these three things:


adjectives
prepositional phrases
noun OR noun phrases


Take a look at all the ‘to-be’ questions from the conversation:


                  * Are you excited for the weekend? (adjective)
                  * Are you tired? (adjective)
                  * Is In-N-Out near the hotel? (prepositional phrase)
                  * Is it usually busy? (adjective)


Each of these questions follows the pattern above. For example:


Is it usually busy?
To-be verb = Is
Subject = it
Object (adjective) = usually busy?


Try changing the questions above into affirmative sentences by swapping the to-be verb with the subject. They would be:


                  * You are excited for the weekend.
                  * You are tired.
                  * In-N-Out is near the hotel.
                  * It is usually busy.



________________




        STRUCTURE


Remember that in questions, the to-be verb comes first. Here is the structure of questions using ‘am · are · is’, with examples:


TABLE-1:


TO-BE VERB
	SUBJECT
	OBJECT
	EXAMPLE QUESTIONS

                  * Are they angry?
                  * Are Pailin and Chloe tired?

	(object)?
	                  * Is he from New York?
                  * Is she at the store?
                  * Is it good?
                  * Is Emily a good dancer?


________________




YES/NO QUESTIONS


A question like ‘Are you tired?’ is called a ‘yes/no question.’ That means you can answer it with a simple ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ answer.


‘Yes’ is an affirmative answer, but in casual conversation, either of these words is used more often:


                  * Yeah
                  * Yep


‘No’ is a negative answer. Either of these words can be used in casual conversation, although ‘no’ is used the most often by far:


                  * No
                  * Nope


Relisten to the conversation and take note of the responses:


                  * Frank: Are you excited for the weekend?
Pailin: Yeah!


                  * Frank: Are you tired?
Pailin: No.


                  * Pailin: Is In-N-Out near the hotel?
Frank: Yep.


                  * Pailin: Is it usually busy?
Frank: Yeah.


‘Yeah,’ ‘yep,’ and ‘no’ are the responses used, as they sound the most natural in everyday conversation. ‘Yes’ is perfectly fine, but it can sound a bit stiff in informal settings.




EXTRA TIPS


SHORT FORM ANSWERS


‘Yes/no’ questions require only a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ response. But these are short and abrupt one-word answers, so to keep the conversation flowing, sometimes a slightly longer ‘short answer’ will be given. Take a look at this exchange from the conversation:


Frank: Are you excited for the weekend?
Pailin: Yeah, I am!


A simple ‘Yeah’ would have been fine, but this short form answer offers a natural flow to the conversation. To answer these to-be verb questions with short form, you can use this structure:


Yeah, (subject) (to-be verb).
No, (subject) (negative to-be verb).


        For example:


                  * Pailin: Are you at the market?
Tyler: Yeah, I am.


                  * Pailin: Is she tired?
Tyler: No, she’s not. (or ‘No, she isn’t.’)


                  * Pailin: Are they Thai?
Tyler: Yep, they are.


                  * Pailin: Am I fat?
Tyler: No, you aren’t! (or ‘No, you’re not!’)


PHRASES & VERBS


Check out (something) / check (something) out = (to look at or examine a person or thing that seems interesting or attractive)
                  * Do you wanna check out this new cafe that just opened down the street?
