They are:\n\n\nam · are · is\n\n\nYou will learn about the to-be verbs 'are' and 'is' in future lessons. This lesson focuses on 'am.'\n\n\n'Am' is ONLY used after the subject 'I,' as in 'I am' or more commonly 'I'm.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## USES OF 'AM'\n\nThere are three basic ways to use 'I'm' in a sentence:\n\n\n   1. I'm (adjective).\n- 'Adjectives' are words that describe nouns.\n- Examples: funny, tall, smart, sick\n\n\n   2. I'm (prepositional phrase).\n- A 'prepositional phrase' begins with a preposition word, such as 'in · at · on · near,' followed by a place. It describes your relationship to a location.\n- Examples: in school, at work, on the train, near the bank\n\n\n   3. I'm (noun OR noun phrase).\n- A 'noun' is a person, place, thing, or idea. A 'noun phrase' is an 'adjective + noun.'\n- Examples: a doctor, an engineer, a good friend, a fast learner\n\n\nClick here to learn more about adjectives, prepositions, nouns, and other parts of speech.\n\n\nConversation examples\nThe lines from the conversation demonstrate 'I'm (adjective)' because the words 'nervous' and 'excited' are adjectives.\n\n\n'I'm' for right now\nIt's important to note that 'I'm' indicates the present state you are in (right now), not the past or future. This will make more sense as you progress through the levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## EXAMPLE SENTENCES\n\nNow that you understand the usage and structure of 'am' in a sentence, take a look at these example sentences. Notice the contracted version 'I'm' is always used:\n\n\n   1. I'm (adjective).\n  - I'm hungry.\n  - I'm sleepy.\n  - I'm smart.\n  - I'm Thai.\n\n      2. I'm (prepositional phrase).\n  - I'm at the market.\n  - I'm in New York.\n  - I'm from Thailand.\n  - I'm by the river.\n\n\n      3. I'm (noun OR noun phrase).\n  - I'm a lawyer.\n  - I'm a good cook.\n  - I'm a quiet person.\n  - I'm a student.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## THAI TO-BE VERBS\n\nThai also has three to-be verbs:\n\n\nเป็น · คือ · อยู่\n\n\nBut while the Thai to-be verbs are used in different contexts, English to-be verbs are used in the same contexts but with different subjects.

Now you'll learn about the second to-be verb, 'are.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## USES OF 'ARE'\n\nTake a look at these sentences from the conversation:\n\n\n  - These pancakes are so good!\n  - You're a great cook.\n  - You're so kind.\n  - They're blueberry pancakes.\n  - The chocolate pancakes are on that table.\n\n\n'Are' is hidden\nAll of these sentences use 'are.' You may not notice this at first because 'are' is often contracted with the subject. For example:\n\n\nYou're a great cook. = You are a great cook.\nThey're blueberry pancakes. = They are blueberry pancakes.\n\n\nWhen to use 'are'\nDo you remember the three ways that 'am' is used? 'Are' is used in the same three ways:\n\n\n         1. are (adjective)\n- 'Adjectives' are words that describe nouns.\n- Examples: big, green, sad, loud\n\n\n         2. are (prepositional phrase)\n- A 'prepositional phrase' begins with a preposition word, such as 'in · at · on · near,' followed by a place. It describes your relationship to a location.\n- Examples: in the car, at work, on the table, near the river\n\n\n         3. are (noun OR noun phrase).\n- A 'noun' is a person, place, thing, or idea. A 'noun phrase' is an 'adjective + noun.'\n- Examples: doctors, books, a good friend, a tall woman\n\n\nClick here to learn more about adjectives, prepositions, nouns, and other parts of speech.\n\n\nIdentify the uses of 'are'\nTry to identify how 'are' is used in the conversation. They're shown below:\n\n\n- These pancakes are so good! (adjective)\n- You're a great cook. (noun phrase)\n- You're so kind. (adjective)\n- They're blueberry pancakes. (noun phrase)\n- The chocolate pancakes are on that table. (prepositional phrase)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## SUBJECTS WITH 'ARE'\n\nWhile 'am' can only follow the subject 'I,' the verb 'are' follows these subjects:\n\n\n        You are\n        We are\n        They are\n        (2+ nouns) are\n\n\n2+ nouns\n'2+ nouns' refers to a 'plural noun.' This means more than one person or thing. In the conversation, 'these pancakes' and 'The chocolate pancakes' are examples because they refer to multiple pancakes.\n\n\nPlural nouns will be explored more in Lesson 3.5.\n\n\nHow to spot 2+ nouns\nFor now, a simple way to recognize a plural noun is that it often ends in -s, like 'pancakes,' 'books,' or 'dogs.' You can see more examples of (2+ nouns) in the section below.\n\n\nNotice that the pronouns 'we' and 'they' are also plural because they refer to more than one person.\n\n\nContractions\nThe subject and 'are' are usually contracted to form one word.\n\n\nYou are = You're\nWe are = We're\nThey are = We're\n\n\nNote that you can't contract (2+ nouns) and 'are.'\n\n\nMy mom and dad're (X)\nMy mom and dad are (✓)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## EXAMPLE SENTENCES\n\nNow that you understand the usage and structure of 'are' in a sentence, take a look at these example sentences. Notice the contractions are used when possible:\n\n\n         1. are (adjective)\n  - You're cute.\n  - We're tired.\n  - Tyler and Mark are tall. (this is an example of 2+ nouns)\n\n            2. are (prepositional phrase)\n  - We're at home.\n  - They're on a boat.\n  - The books are in my bag. (this is an example of 2+ nouns)\n\n\n            3. are (noun OR noun phrase)\n  - You're an engineer.\n  - We're doctors.\n  - Those men are waiters. (this is an example of 2+ nouns)",

Now you'll learn about the last to-be verb, 'is.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## USES OF 'IS'\n\nTake a look at these sentences from the conversation:\n\n\n  - He's in LA.\n  - It's a good school.\n  - He's very smart.\n  - My mom's a nurse.\n\n\n'Is' is hidden\nAll of these sentences use 'is.' You may not notice this at first because 'is' is usually contracted with the subject. For example:\n\n\nHe's in LA. = He is in LA.\nIt's a good school. = It is a good school.\n\n\nWhen to use 'is'\nDo you remember the three ways that 'am' and 'are' are used? 'Is' is used in the same three ways:\n\n\n            1. is (adjective)\n- 'Adjectives' are words that describe nouns.\n- Examples: hot, tired, yellow, heavy\n\n\n            2. is (prepositional phrase)\n- A 'prepositional phrase' begins with a preposition word, such as 'in · at · on · near,' followed by a place. It describes your relationship to a location.\n- Examples: in the kitchen, at the store, on the desk, near the post office\n\n\n            3. is (noun OR noun phrase).\n- A 'noun' is a person, place, thing, or idea. A 'noun phrase' is an 'adjective + noun.'\n- Examples: a nurse, a phone, a talented singer, a brown dog\n\n\nClick here to learn more about adjectives, prepositions, nouns, and other parts of speech.\n\n\nIdentify the uses of 'is'\nTry to identify how 'is' is used in the conversation.

(noun)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## SUBJECTS WITH 'IS'\n\nYou've learned that 'am' only follows 'I', and 'are' follows 'you · we · they · 2+ nouns.' The verb 'is' follows these subjects:\n\n\nHe is\nShe is\nIt is\n(Noun) is\n\n\n1 noun\n'Noun' refers to just one noun, called a 'singular noun.' In the conversation, 'my mom' is an example of this because she is just one person. A singular noun doesn't have to be a person - it can be an item, such as 'The key' or 'My house.'\n\n\nNotice that 'he,' 'she,' and 'it' also refer to a single person or thing, so they are 'singular nouns.' You can see examples of singular nouns and plural nouns in the Extra Tips section.\n\n\nContractions\nThe subject and 'is' are usually contracted to form one word.\n\n\nHe is = He's\nShe is = She's\nIt is = It's\n(Noun) is = (Noun)'s\n\n\nRemember, contractions make a sentence smoother and sound more natural.

For example:\n\n\n\n\t\tI’m from (place).\n\n\n\n* I’m from the north of Thailand.\n* I’m from Isaan.\n* I’m from Texas.\n* I’m from the Bay.\n\n**I’m + (prepositional phrase)**\n\nNotice that these responses use ‘I’m (prepositional phrase)’, as the word ‘from’ is a preposition.\n\n"

In this lesson, you'll learn how to make questions with these verbs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## TO-BE VERB QUESTIONS\n\nIn the conversation, Frank asks Pailin:\n\n  - Are you tired?\n\n\nCompare the question with this related affirmative sentence:\n\n\n  - You are tired.\n\n\nDo you see how the position of the words changed? The subject 'you' and the to-be verb 'are' swapped places to form a question.\n\n\nTo-be question structure\nAll to-be verb questions follow this pattern:\n\n\n(To-be verb) (subject) (object).\n\n\nAs you might recall, the 'object' of the sentence can be one of these three things:\n\n\n- adjectives\n- prepositional phrases\n- noun OR noun phrases\n\n\nExamples\nTake a look at all the 'to-be' questions from the conversation:\n\n\n  - Are you excited for the weekend? (adjective)\n  - Are you tired? (adjective)\n  - Is In-N-Out near the hotel? (prepositional phrase)\n  - Is it usually busy? (adjective)\n\n\nEach of these questions follows the pattern above. For example:\n\n\nIs it usually busy?\nTo-be verb = Is\nSubject = it\nObject (adjective) = usually busy?\n\n\nTurning questions into sentences\nTry changing the questions above into affirmative sentences by swapping the to-be verb with the subject. They would be:\n\n\n  - You are excited for the weekend.\n  - You are tired.\n  - In-N-Out is near the hotel.\n  - It is usually busy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## STRUCTURE\n\nRemember that in questions, the to-be verb comes first.\n\n\nHere is the structure of questions using 'am · are · is', with examples:\n\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n   <td><strong>TO-BE VERB</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>SUBJECT</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>OBJECT</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    <strong>EXAMPLE QUESTIONS</strong>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Am\n   </td>\n   <td>I\n   </td>\n   <td>(object)?\n   </td>\n   <td>\n<ul>\n\n<li>Am I tall?</li>\n</ul>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Are\n   </td>\n   <td>you\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\nwe\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\nthey\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\n2+ nouns\n   </td>\n   <td>(object)?\n   </td>\n   <td>\n<ul>\n\n<li>Are you an engineer?</li>\n\n<li>Are we at the bus stop?</li>\n\n<li>Are they angry?</li>\n\n<li>Are Pailin and Chloe tired?</li>\n</ul>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Is\n   </td>\n   <td>he\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\nshe\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\nit\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\nnoun\n   </td>\n   <td>(object)?\n   </td>\n   <td>\n<ul>\n\n<li>Is he from New York?</li>\n\n<li>Is she at the store?</li>\n\n<li>Is it good?</li>\n\n<li>Is Emily a good dancer?</li>\n</ul>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYES/NO QUESTIONS\n\n\nA question like 'Are you tired?' is called a 'yes/no question.' That means you can answer it with a simple 'Yes' or 'No' answer.\n\n\nYeah\n'Yes' is an affirmative answer, but in casual conversation, either of these words is used more often:\n\n\n  - Yeah\n  - Yep\n\n\nNo\n'No' is a negative answer.
