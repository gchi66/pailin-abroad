'Hi' is said in both casual and formal settings.\n\nAnother casual and friendly way to greet people is:\n\n* Hey\n\nThis works with family, friends, and acquaintances, but is very casual and shouldn't be used in formal settings.\n\nYou've likely learned to use this greeting:\n\n* Hello\n\nThis can also be used to greet anyone, although it's most natural to say it to strangers. It sounds a bit formal and polite, so it isn't used as often in everyday conversation, especially with friends and family.\n\nThe three greetings above can be said at any time of day.

It creates a polite and sometimes professional connection. Just as foreigners should practice how to 'wai' when visiting Thailand, you should practice your handshake - it should be firm, but not too strong. Shaking hands is common in these settings:\n\n- At work or professional settings\n- Introducing yourself to a stranger, like a neighbor\n- Meeting a friend of a friend for the first time, regardless of gender\n\nHugging has become a common greeting that shows warmth, friendliness, and a more personal connection than a handshake. Deciding whether to hug someone or give them a handshake often depends on the relationship and context:\n\n- Casual first meetings. For women meeting a new acquaintance (especially another woman) in a casual setting, a light hug is common. When a woman casually meets a new acquaintance who's a man, either a handshake OR a hug might be appropriate\n- With friends. Hugging is very common among friends, particularly women, even if they see each other often\n- Family: Hugs are the standard greeting for family members, including aunts, uncles, and grandparents\n\nThere is one more greeting: the 'bro hug.' Men sometimes greet each other with a casual 'bro hug,' which is more personable than a formal handshake. The 'bro hug' starts with a handshake, then becomes a brief pat on the back or hug with the left hand. This is common for:\n\n- A man meeting a male friend of a friend for the first time\n- Guy friends greeting each other\n- Note: Women typically don't do this with each other or with men. You should also avoid doing the 'bro hug' in professional settings\n\nAmerican greetings usually involve physical touch. If you're uncomfortable with this, you can simply wave and say 'Hi' when meeting someone for the first time."

While it is a question, it's more of a social formality that's used to begin a conversation.\n\nPailin responds to Kevin's question with:\n\n* I'm great, thanks, and you?\n\nThis is a standard response. Notice that it's very brief and positive, and she doesn't go into detail of how she's actually feeling. Even if she isn't feeling great, she keeps the response positive and light. Other typical responses include:\n\n* I'm good.\nCan be shortened to 'Good!'\n\n* I'm great.\nCan be shortened to 'Great!'\n\n* I'm alright.\nCan be shortened to 'Alright.'\n\nDo you notice a response that's not shown above? 'I'm fine.' While this is a perfectly good response, it sounds less friendly and natural than the ones above.\n\nPailin adds 'thanks' to her sentence for added politeness. It's like saying 'Thanks for asking.'\n\nLastly, she finishes with 'and you?' to return the question back to Kevin.\n\nHere's another example of this kind of exchange:\n\n* Pailin: How are you?\nKevin: Good!

It sounds relaxed, casual, and friendly.\n\n* Store Clerk: How's it going?\nPailin: Good!\n*'Well!' is the correct response grammatically, but in casual spoken English, most people respond with 'Good!'\n\n* How've you been?\nYou can say this to friends or acquaintances you haven't seen in a while.\n\n* Chai: How've you been?\nPailin: I've been great!\n\n* How's everything?\nYou can also say this to friends or acquaintances you haven't seen in a while.\n\n* Lek: How's everything?\nPailin: Everything is good!\n\n* What's up?\nThis is very casual and should only be said to friends you see on a regular basis.

If an acquaintance asks you 'How are you?' you should answer with something positive, even if you've had a bad day, such as one of these responses:\n\n* Good, thanks.\n* I'm okay.\n\nBut if a close friend or family member asks how you're doing, you can of course give a more in-depth answer, whether your day was great or bad. See the example conversations below:\n\n* Pailin: How are you?\nDara: Not too good, I just got fired from my job.\nPailin: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that!\n\n* Chloe: How are you?\nPailin: A bit tired. I didn't sleep well. How about you?\nChloe: I'm good, thanks.\n\n## FRIENDLY EMPLOYEES\n\nIn Thailand, it's not typical for store or restaurant staff to ask customers สบายดีไหมครับ or เป็นยังไงบ้างครับ. These questions roughly translate to 'How are you?' and are usually said between people who know each other or are meeting on a personal level. But in the US, it's very common for employees to greet customers with 'How are you?' or similar phrases. You may have noticed foreign travelers in Thailand sometimes ask สบายดีไหมครับ to servers. This is because it's the cultural norm to have this type of interaction with employees."

Chloe also describes her feelings:\n\n   * I'm nervous, but I'm excited!\n\nNotice that they both use 'I'm' in their sentences.\n\nI'm = I am\n\nThe phrase 'I am' is said so often in English that it's almost always shortened to 'I'm.' The verb 'am' is called a 'to-be' verb, and it is one of three to-be verbs. They are:\n\nam · are · is\n\nYou will learn about the to-be verbs 'are' and 'is' in future lessons. This lesson focuses on 'am.'\n\n'Am' is ONLY used after the subject 'I,' as in 'I am' or more commonly 'I'm.'\n\n## USES OF 'AM'\n\nThere are three basic ways to use 'I'm' in a sentence:\n\n1. I'm (adjective).\n'Adjectives' are words that describe nouns.\nExamples: funny, tall, smart, sick\n\n2. I'm (prepositional phrase).\nA 'prepositional phrase' begins with a preposition word, such as 'in · at · on · near,' followed by a place. It describes your relationship to a location.\nExamples: in school, at work, on the train, near the bank\n\n3. I'm (noun OR noun phrase).\nA 'noun' is a person, place, thing, or idea. A 'noun phrase' is an 'adjective + noun.'\nExamples: a doctor, an engineer, a good friend, a fast learner\n\nClick here to learn more about adjectives, prepositions, nouns, and other parts of speech.\n\nThe lines from the conversation demonstrate 'I'm (adjective)' because the words 'nervous' and 'excited' are adjectives. It's important to note that 'I'm' indicates the present state you are in (right now), not the past or future. This will make more sense as you progress through the levels.\n\n## EXAMPLE SENTENCES\n\nNow that you understand the usage and structure of 'am' in a sentence, take a look at these example sentences. Notice the contracted version 'I'm' is always used:\n\n   1. I'm (adjective).\n   * I'm hungry.\n   * I'm sleepy.\n   * I'm smart.\n   * I'm Thai.\n\n      2. I'm (prepositional phrase).\n      * I'm at the market.\n      * I'm in New York.\n      * I'm from Thailand.\n      * I'm by the river.\n\n      3. I'm (noun OR noun phrase).\n      * I'm a lawyer.\n      * I'm a good cook.\n      * I'm a quiet person.\n      * I'm a student.\n\n## THAI TO-BE VERBS\n\nThai also has three to-be verbs:\n\nเป็น · คือ · อยู่\n\nBut while the Thai to-be verbs are used in different contexts, English to-be verbs are used in the same contexts but with different subjects. This will become clearer in later lessons."

        "content_md": "## MISTAKE #1\n\nThai people often omit the word 'am' in a sentence, for example 'I tired' or 'I hungry.' This is likely because they are translating a sentence directly from Thai to English. Take a look at these two sentences in Thai from the conversation:\n\nฉันกังวล\nฉันตื่นเต้น\n\nThere is no verb in these sentences. When translated into English word for word, they become:\n\nฉันกังวล\nI nervous. (X)\n\nฉันตื่นเต้น\nI excited. (X)\n\nThese are incorrect because they don't have a verb. In English, every sentence must have a verb. The sentences above must be:\n\n      * I'm nervous. (✓)\n      * I'm excited. (✓)\n\n## MISTAKE #2\n\nAnother common error is leaving out the subject of a sentence. This is because in Thai, the subject of a sentence is usually omitted when it's clear from the context who the subject is. For example:\n\nหิวค่ะ\n\nTranslated directly, this would just be 'Hungry.' The sentence makes sense in Thai because the subject is understood from the context. But in English, every sentence must have a subject AND a verb! So the sentence above must be:\n\n      * I'm hungry.\n\nRemember to always use the word 'I' when talking about yourself.\n\n## MISTAKE #3\n\nIn this conversation, you saw two adjectives - 'excited' and 'nervous' - which learners sometimes confuse.\n\n'Excited' means you feel a lot of energy, but in a happy or positive way. For example:\n\n      * I'm excited to go to Disneyland!\n\n'Nervous' also means you have a lot of energy, but it's a more negative feeling of worry or unease. For example:\n\n      * I'm nervous about meeting my boyfriend's parents."

In many Asian cultures, respect is often automatically given to elders. However, in many Western cultures like the US, elders are not automatically shown respect simply because they are older. Respect is usually earned through actions, personality, or position.\n\nAlso important to note is that asking someone's age, especially upon first meeting, can be considered impolite or sometimes even rude to ask. This is because age can be a sensitive topic, and some people prefer not to discuss it. It's more appropriate to ask about age when you've gotten to know someone better, they appear to be close to your age, or the topic comes up naturally in conversation.\n\nThere is even a saying in English, 'Never ask a woman about her age.' Even if your intentions are pure, asking a woman her age can get you in trouble. They might assume that they look old and that's why you're asking, so it's best to avoid asking unless they bring it up."

Now you'll learn about the second to-be verb, 'are.'\n\n## USES OF 'ARE'\n\nTake a look at these sentences from the conversation:\n\n         * These pancakes are so good!\n         * You're a great cook.\n         * You're so kind.\n         * They're blueberry pancakes.\n         * The chocolate pancakes are on that table.\n\nAll of these sentences use 'are.' You may not notice this at first because 'are' is often contracted with the subject. For example:\n\nYou're a great cook. = You are a great cook.\nThey're blueberry pancakes. = They are blueberry pancakes.\n\nDo you remember the three ways that 'am' is used? 'Are' is used in the same three ways:\n\n         1. are (adjective)\n'Adjectives' are words that describe nouns.\nExamples: big, green, sad, loud\n\n         2. are (prepositional phrase)\nA 'prepositional phrase' begins with a preposition word, such as 'in · at · on · near,' followed by a place. It describes your relationship to a location.\nExamples: in the car, at work, on the table, near the river\n\n         3. are (noun OR noun phrase).\nA 'noun' is a person, place, thing, or idea. A 'noun phrase' is an 'adjective + noun.'\nExamples: doctors, books, a good friend, a tall woman\n\nClick here to learn more about adjectives, prepositions, nouns, and other parts of speech.\n\nTry to identify how 'are' is used in the conversation. They're shown below:\n\nThese pancakes are so good! (adjective)\nYou're a great cook. (noun phrase)\nYou're so kind. (adjective)\nThey're blueberry pancakes. (noun phrase)\nThe chocolate pancakes are on that table. (prepositional phrase)\n\n## SUBJECTS WITH 'ARE'\n\nWhile 'am' can only follow the subject 'I,' the verb 'are' follows these subjects:\n\n        You are\n        We are\n        They are\n        (2+ nouns) are\n\n'2+ nouns' refers to a 'plural noun.' This means more than one person or thing. In the conversation, 'these pancakes' and 'The chocolate pancakes' are examples because they refer to multiple pancakes. Plural nouns will be explored more in Lesson 3.5. For now, a simple way to recognize a plural noun is that it often ends in -s, like 'pancakes,' 'books,' or 'dogs.' You can see more examples of (2+ nouns) in the section below.\n\nNotice that the pronouns 'we' and 'they' are also plural because they refer to more than one person.\n\nThe subject and 'are' are usually contracted to form one word.\n\nYou are = You're\nWe are = We're\nThey are = We're\n\nNote that you can't contract (2+ nouns) and 'are.'\n\nMy mom and dad're (X)\nMy mom and dad are (✓)\n\n## EXAMPLE SENTENCES\n\nNow that you understand the usage and structure of 'are' in a sentence, take a look at these example sentences. Notice the contractions are used when possible:\n\n         1. are (adjective)\n         * You're cute.\n         * We're tired.\n         * Your mom and dad are tall. (this is an example of 2+ nouns)\n\n            2. are (prepositional phrase)\n            * We're at home.\n            * They're on a boat.\n            * My kids are at school. (this is an example of 2+ nouns)\n\n            3. are (noun OR noun phrase)\n            * You're an engineer.\n            * We're doctors.\n            * Those men are waiters. (this is an example of 2+ nouns)"

This is likely because they are translating a sentence directly from Thai to English. Take a look at these sentences in Thai from the conversation:\n\nแพนเค้กเหล่านี้อร่อยมาก\nคุณใจดีมาก\n\nThere are no verbs in these sentences. When translated into English word for word, they become:\n\n        แพนเค้กเหล่านี้อร่อยมาก\n        These pancakes so good. (X)\n\nคุณใจดีมาก\nYou so kind. (X)\n\nThese are incorrect because there is no verb. In English, every sentence must have a verb. The sentences above must be:\n\n            * These pancakes are so good.

A 'noun phrase' is an 'adjective + noun.'\nExamples: a nurse, a phone, a talented singer, a brown dog\n\nClick here to learn more about adjectives, prepositions, nouns, and other parts of speech.\n\nTry to identify how 'is' is used in the conversation. They're shown below:\n\nHe's in LA. (prepositional phrase)\nIt's a good school. (noun phrase)\nHe's very smart. (adjective)\nMy mom's a nurse. (noun)\n\n## SUBJECTS WITH 'IS'\n\nYou've learned that 'am' only follows 'I', and 'are' follows 'you · we · they · 2+ nouns.' The verb 'is' follows these subjects:\n\nHe is\nShe is\nIt is\n(Noun) is\n\n'Noun' refers to just one noun, called a 'singular noun.' In the conversation, 'my mom' is an example of this because she is just one person. A singular noun doesn't have to be a person - it can be an item, such as 'The key' or 'My house.' Notice that 'he,' 'she,' and 'it' also refer to a single person or thing, so they are 'singular nouns.' You can see examples of singular nouns and plural nouns in the Extra Tips section.\n\nThe subject and 'is' are usually contracted to form one word.\n\nHe is = He's\nShe is = She's\nIt is = It's\n(Noun) is = (Noun)'s\n\nRemember, contractions make a sentence smoother and sound more natural. The line 'My mom's a nurse' flows better than 'My mom is a nurse.'\n\n## EXAMPLE SENTENCES\n\nTake a look at these example sentences. Notice the contractions are used when possible:\n\n            1. is (adjective)\n            * He's funny.\n            * She's smart.\n            * Joey's tired. (this is an example of a singular noun)\n\n               2. is (prepositional phrase)\n               * It's in the box.\n               * She's at the post office.\n               * My dog's outside. (this is an example of a singular noun)\n\n               3. is (noun OR noun phrase)\n               * He's a good soccer player.\n               * It's a scary movie.\n               * Mark is a lawyer. (this is an example of a singular noun)"

PLURAL NOUNS\n\nNow you've learned these rules:\n\n(Noun) is\n(2+ nouns) are\n\nWithout going in-depth, remember that an easy way to spot a plural noun (2+ nouns) is that it often ends in -s, like 'pancakes,' 'books,' or 'dogs.' Take a look at this line from the conversation:\n\n               * His classes are hard.\n\nThe word 'class' has -es added to the end, so the sentence refers to multiple classes.

You can use it to describe almost anything! Think of different adjectives and practice using them in this structure. The more you practice, the more natural it will become.\n\nNotice that in Thai, this sentence doesn't have a subject:\n\nแพงมาก\n\nSince every sentence in English must have a subject, 'It's' would be a typical subject for a descriptive sentence like this. So instead of just saying 'Expensive!' you must say 'It's expensive!'\n\nIn the conversation, the structure 'It's (adjective)' is used to discuss the weather, the food, and pricing, but it can be used to describe anything! Take a look at these descriptive sentences below:\n\n                  * It's late.\n                  * It's difficult.\n                  * It's important.\n                  * It's blue.\n                  * It's nice to meet you."

        "content_md": "## LESSON FOCUS\n\nHow to use 'not' in a sentence\n\nSo far, you've learned how to make affirmative sentences with the to-be verbs 'am · are · is.' In this lesson, you'll learn how to make those sentences negative using the word 'not.'\n\n## NEGATIVE SENTENCES\n\nIn the conversation, Pailin says to Frank:\n\n                  * I'm not cold.\n\nWhile the affirmative sentence would be 'I'm cold,' adding 'not' changes the sentence into a negative sentence.\n\n'Not' is used to negate ALL verbs in English. This lesson will focus on negating simple sentences that use to-be verbs.\n\nTake a look at these sentences from the conversation:\n\n                  * My jacket isn't blue.\n                  * It isn't there.\n                  * It's not a big deal.\n                  * I'm not cold.\n\nIn the first two sentences, you can't see the word 'not.' This is because it's combined with the to-be verb to form a negative contraction:\n\nIt isn't there. = It is not there.\n\nThese will be explained more below.\n\n## STRUCTURE\n\n        Notice where the word 'not' comes in a sentence. Is it before or after the to-be verb?\n\nMy jacket isn't blue.\nMy jacket is not blue.\n\n'Not' comes after the to-be verb, so it will always follow this pattern:\n\nam not\nare not\nis not\n\nRemember that contractions are key in English because they help shorten your speech and make it sound natural. There is only one way to contract 'I am not':\n\n        I'm not\n\nBut there are two ways to contract 'are not' and 'is not' in a sentence, as you can see from these lines in the conversation:\n\nIt isn't there.\nIt's not a big deal.\n\n'It is not' can become:\n\nIt isn't\nIt's not\n\n'They are not' can become either:\n\nThey aren't\nThey're not\n\nBoth forms are frequently used, so it's important to know both. Here is a breakdown of 'are' and 'is' in negative sentences:\n\n<!-- TABLE 1 MISSING -->\n\nSingular noun subjects can also be contracted in both ways:\n\n(Noun)'s not = (Noun) isn't\nMy mom's not = My mom isn't\nFrank's not = Frank isn't\n\nBut for subjects of 2+ nouns, only one contraction can be used:\n\n(2+ nouns) aren't\nMy mom and dad aren't\nThe kids aren't\n\n## EXAMPLES\n\nRemember that to-be verbs can come before these three things:\n\nadjectives\nprepositional phrases\nnouns OR noun phrases\n\nThe same applies to negative to-be verbs. Here are examples of negative sentences. Notice that both forms of contractions are used for 'are not' and 'is not.'\n\n## AM NOT\n                  * I'm not hungry. (adjective)\n                  * I'm not from China. (prepositional phrase)\n                  * I'm not a good cook. (noun phrase)\n\n## ARE NOT\n                  * You aren't sick. (adjective)\n                  * We're not at home. (prepositional phrase)\n                  * They aren't fun people. (noun phrase)\n                  * Pailin and Chloe aren't sisters. (noun)\n\n## IS NOT\n                  * He isn't ready. (adjective)\n                  * She's not in the garage. (prepositional phrase)\n                  * It isn't a toy. (noun)\n                  * Frank's not tired. (adjective)\n                  * My friend isn't here. (prepositional phrase)"

Pailin responds by saying:\n\n                  * It's 11:05.\n\n        The sentence structure to tell the time is:\n\n                It's (time).\n\n        Telling the time is pretty straight-forward, although there are a few things to note.\n\n## O'CLOCK\n\nIn the conversation, Frank tells the girls:\n\n                  * Please come back at 12:00.\n\n        On the hour, the time can be read as:\n\n                (#) o'clock\n                  * 5 o'clock = 5:00\n\n        Often, 'o'clock' is omitted. Frank could have also said:\n\n                  * Please come back at 12.\n\n## TELLING TIME WITH '0' 12:01 - 12:09\n\nDid you notice how Pailin said the time 11:05? She didn't say 'eleven five' or 'eleven zero five.' She said:\n\n                  * 11:05 = eleven-o-five\n\n        The 0 is pronounced as the letter 'O' or 'oh.'\n\n[[QUICK_PRACTICE_1]]\n\n## TELLING TIME WITHOUT '0' 12:10 - 12:59\n\nAll other times are read as two numbers - the hour, the minutes. In the conversation, Chloe says that her favorite restaurant opens at:\n\n                  * 11:30 = eleven thirty\n\n[[QUICK_PRACTICE_2]]\n\n## AM & PM\n\nTelling the time in Thai is a bit complex, as the hours of the day are broken down into different intervals. In English, the day is divided into just two sets:\n\n                  * AM = midnight (12:00) to lunchtime (11:59)\n                  * PM = lunchtime (12:00) to midnight (11:59)\n\nThe hours go from 1 to 12. Frank tells the girls to please come back at 12:00. Would this be referred to as 12AM or 12PM?\n\nIt would be 12PM. This time can be referred to as 'noon.' Meanwhile, 12AM is often referred to as 'midnight.' For example:\n\n                  * Let's meet at the park at noon.\n                  * I always sleep at midnight.\n\nWhile many countries use military time (a 24-hour clock instead of the 12-hour clock), it's not often used in the US. You will almost never hear someone refer to 9PM as 21:00 (21 o'clock)."

In this lesson, you'll learn how to make questions with these verbs.\n\n## TO-BE VERB QUESTIONS\n\nIn the conversation, Frank asks Pailin:\n\n                  * Are you tired?\n\nCompare the question with this related affirmative sentence:\n\n                  * You are tired.\n\nDo you see how the position of the words changed? The subject 'you' and the to-be verb 'are' swapped places to form a question. All to-be verb questions follow this pattern:\n\n(To-be verb) (subject) (object).\n\nAs you might recall, the 'object' of the sentence can be one of these three things:\n\nadjectives\nprepositional phrases\nnoun OR noun phrases\n\nTake a look at all the 'to-be' questions from the conversation:\n\n                  * Are you excited for the weekend? (adjective)\n                  * Are you tired? (adjective)\n                  * Is In-N-Out near the hotel? (prepositional phrase)\n                  * Is it usually busy? (adjective)\n\nEach of these questions follows the pattern above. For example:\n\nIs it usually busy?\nTo-be verb = Is\nSubject = it\nObject (adjective) = usually busy?\n\nTry changing the questions above into affirmative sentences by swapping the to-be verb with the subject. They would be:\n\n                  * You are excited for the weekend.\n                  * You are tired.\n                  * In-N-Out is near the hotel.\n                  * It is usually busy.\n\n## STRUCTURE\n\nRemember that in questions, the to-be verb comes first. Here is the structure of questions using 'am · are · is', with examples:\n\n<!-- TABLE 2 MISSING -->\n\nYES/NO QUESTIONS\n\nA question like 'Are you tired?' is called a 'yes/no question.' That means you can answer it with a simple 'Yes' or 'No' answer.\n\n'Yes' is an affirmative answer, but in casual conversation, either of these words is used more often:\n\n                  * Yeah\n                  * Yep\n\n'No' is a negative answer. Either of these words can be used in casual conversation, although 'no' is used the most often by far:\n\n                  * No\n                  * Nope\n\nRelisten to the conversation and take note of the responses:\n\n                  * Frank: Are you excited for the weekend?\nPailin: Yeah!\n\n                  * Frank: Are you tired?\nPailin: No.\n\n                  * Pailin: Is In-N-Out near the hotel?\nFrank: Yep.\n\n                  * Pailin: Is it usually busy?\nFrank: Yeah.\n\n'Yeah,' 'yep,' and 'no' are the responses used, as they sound the most natural in everyday conversation. 'Yes' is perfectly fine, but it can sound a bit stiff in informal settings."

But these are short and abrupt one-word answers, so to keep the conversation flowing, sometimes a slightly longer 'short answer' will be given. Take a look at this exchange from the conversation:\n\nFrank: Are you excited for the weekend?\nPailin: Yeah, I am!\n\nA simple 'Yeah' would have been fine, but this short form answer offers a natural flow to the conversation. To answer these to-be verb questions with short form, you can use this structure:\n\nYeah, (subject) (to-be verb).\nNo, (subject) (negative to-be verb).\n\n        For example:\n\n                  * Pailin: Are you at the market?\nTyler: Yeah, I am.\n\n                  * Pailin: Is she tired?\nTyler: No, she's not. (or 'No, she isn't.')\n\n                  * Pailin: Are they Thai?\nTyler: Yep, they are.\n\n                  * Pailin: Am I fat?\nTyler: No, you aren't! (or 'No, you're not!')"
