        "content_md": "## LESSON FOCUS\n\nHow to use the word ‘sorry’\n\n## SORRY\n\n‘Sorry’ is a very important word to know. It’s used to apologize for a wide range of situations, from small inconveniences to major incidents. It can be said by itself or as part of a sentence. You can add the word ‘so’ before sorry to make it stronger.\n\n* Sorry.\n* I’m sorry.\n* I’m so sorry.\n\n'Sorry’ can be used for all sorts of situations!\n\nMinor incident:\n\nYou bump into someone:\n* Oops, sorry!\n\nYou ask someone a question, but realize that you interrupted a conversation:\n* Sorry, I’ll ask you my question later.\n\nAccidents:\n\nYou broke your friend’s mug:\n* So sorry, Sylvie, but I broke your mug when I was washing it.\n\nYou spilled wine on your friend’s nice jacket.\n* I’m so sorry. Let me try to wash the stain out now.\n\nDeep regret:\n\nYou and your brother had a huge argument earlier, and you want to apologize for the hurtful things you said.\n* I’m so sorry about what I said. I crossed a line.\n\nYou promised your friend you would help her move out, but you can’t come anymore because you got called into work.\n* I’m so sorry, but I can’t help you move today. I just got called into work.\n\nSORRY + REASON\n\nA simple way to apologize is:\n\nSorry + (reason you’re sorry).\n\nThe reason should be a complete sentence. Here are examples from the conversation:\n\n* Sorry we’re late!\nWe're late! = the reason Mark is sorry\n\n* Sorry the house is a little messy.\nThe house is a little messy = the reason Sylvie is sorry\n\nYou can also apologize for someone else’s mishap. When Emily asks Pailin a rather personal question, Sylvie apologies for Emily’s behavior:\n\n* Sorry, she's so rude.\n\nHere are more examples of using 'sorry' in this way:\n\n* I'm so sorry I said that to you.\n* Sorry I forgot your birthday.\n* I'm sorry I wasn't paying attention.\n\n## SORRY FOR (VERB-ING)\n\nNotice how Luke apologizes to Pailin when he accidentally drops her suitcase:\n\n* I'm so sorry for dropping your suitcase!\n\nHe gives a specific reason for his apology, but he uses a different structure:\n\nSorry for (verb-ing)\nSorry for not (verb-ing)\n\nIn Luke’s apology, the base verb is ‘drop’, but -ing is added so it becomes ‘dropping’ in this sentence. Here are examples of the three sentences from the section above, but using this structure. The base verb is shown in (parenthesis):\n\n* I’m so sorry for saying that to you. (say)\n* Sorry for forgetting your birthday. (forget)\n* I’m sorry for not paying attention. (pay)\n\nYou can use ‘sorry for (verb-ing),’ or you can use ‘sorry + reason’ and the meaning is the same! You can choose whichever one you want to use.\n\nTHAT’S OKAY\n\nThere are several ways to respond to someone who has apologized to you. In the conversation, Sylvie apologizes to Pailin for Emily's embarrassing question. Also, Luke apologizes for dropping Pailin's suitcase. Pailin responds with:\n\n* That's okay!\n* It's okay!\n\nThese are typical ways to respond if an incident or inconvenience isn’t a big deal. Then, when Sylvie apologizes to Pailin about the house being a little messy, Pailin reassures Sylvie by saying:\n\n* Don't worry!\n\nYou can also say:\n\n* No worries!\n\nThe above four phrases are best used for minor inconveniences.\n\nHere are other ways to respond to ‘sorry’:\n\n* I understand.\nYou can say this when someone gives you a valid excuse for why they can’t help you or do something for you. When you tell them, 'I understand,' it shows empathy and acknowledges their situation.\n\n* Adam: Sorry I can’t come to your birthday party. I want to go, but I promised my sister I would babysit her kids.\nChloe: It’s okay, I understand.\n\n* Don’t be sorry.\nYou can say this when someone is overly apologetic about something small and you don’t want them to feel guilty.\n\n* Pailin: I’m so sorry I lost your shirt. I don’t know where it could be.\nTyler: Don’t be sorry. It was an old shirt."

        "content_md": "## SORRY TO SHOW SYMPATHY\n\nWhen someone is experiencing hardship or misfortune, you can say 'I'm so sorry' to show empathy and acknowledge their pain. This expression is used to offer support during difficult times, such as the death of a loved one, health issues, a divorce or breakup, or any other challenging life circumstances. For example:\n\n* I'm so sorry for your loss.\n* I'm so sorry you're going through this.\n\nNote that this use of 'sorry' expresses sympathy, not responsibility for the other person's situation.\n\n## APOLOGIZING FOR FUTURE EVENTS\n\nTo apologize for something that might happen in the future and potentially cause inconvenience or discomfort, you can follow this structure:\n\nSorry if (reason you’re sorry).\n\nThe reason should be a complete sentence in present simple tense, even though the event would potentially happen in the future. For example:\n\n* Sorry if I wake you up in the morning.\nI wake you up in the morning = the reason you're sorry\n\n* Sorry if I come late. There’s so much traffic today.\n* Sorry if I forget your name. I’m so bad with names.\n* Sorry if my phone rings during the meeting. I’m expecting a call.\n\nNO, SORRY\n\nWhen you're unable to fulfill a simple request or answer a question, you can respond with:\n\n* No, sorry.\n* I don't know, sorry.\n\nAdding ‘sorry’ is a polite way to acknowledge the minor inconvenience.\n\nFor example:\n\n* Pailin: Do you have any change for the parking meter?\nLuke: No, sorry.\n\n* Pailin: Excuse me, do you know where the metro station is?\nStranger: I don’t know, sorry. I’m not from around here."

You might say, ‘Sorry, I actually ordered a burger’ even though it’s the server’s mistake.\n\nCanadians are particularly known for reflexively saying ‘sorry’ all the time, even when they’ve done nothing wrong. Like if someone steps on their foot, they might say ‘Sorry!’ even though the other person is at fault.\n\nIn instances like these, ‘sorry’ is more of a polite filler word than a real apology."

        "content_md": "## LESSON FOCUS\n\nHow to make negative sentences with ‘don’t’ and ‘doesn’t’\nVerb tense: Present simple tense\n\n## NEGATIVE SENTENCES\n\nSo far, you’ve learned how to make affirmative sentences in present simple tense (I drink coffee every morning). In this lesson, you’ll learn how to make those sentences negative using the words ‘don’t’ and ‘doesn’t.’\n\nCompare these two sentences from the conversation:\n\n* I don't like my classes.\n* He doesn't like it very much.\n\nIn Lesson 1.16, you learned that ‘not’ is used to negate ALL verbs in English. The two sentences above contain the word ‘not,’ although it may not be obvious at first glance. That’s because ‘not’ is contracted with the auxiliary verb ‘do’ or ‘does’.\n\ndon’t = do not\ndoesn’t = does not\n\nThese two words make present simple tense sentences negative. Notice their position in the sentences. They come after the subject and before the main verb:\n\n(Subject) don’t (verb)\n(Subject) doesn’t (verb)\n\nNow take a look at the main verb in these lines from the conversation:\n\n* My friend wants to try Engineering.\n* My dad doesn't want me to change my major.\n\nIn the first sentence, -s is added to the end of verb ‘want’ because it follows ‘he · she · it · noun.’ What do you notice about the second sentence? The verb ‘want’ doesn’t have an -s even though the subject is ‘he’. Instead, the negative auxiliary verb ‘do not’ takes the -s to become ‘does not,’ while the main verb ‘want’ stays in its base form.\n\n## USES & STRUCTURE\n\nRemember that present simple tense is used to talk about routines, habits, feelings, and general knowledge, like facts and widely accepted truths. In the same way, negative present simple tense is used to describe things that don’t happen regularly, or for things you don’t know, feel, or believe.\n\nHere is the structure of ‘don’t’ and ‘doesn’t in a sentence with some examples.\n\n## SUBJECT\n\t(-)\n## VERB\n## EXAMPLE SENTENCES\n## I\nYou\nWe\nThey\n2+ Nouns\n\tdon’t\n\t(verb)\n\t* I don’t drive.\n* You don’t travel often.\n* We don’t know the answer.\n* They don’t see you.\n* My parents don’t live in Florida.\n\tHe\nShe\nIt\n1 Noun\n\tdoesn’t\n\t(verb)\n\t* He doesn’t drink coffee.\n* She doesn’t exercise often.\n* It doesn’t work.\n* Enzo doesn’t cook well.\n\nQuick Practice: Change the sentences from affirmative to negative by entering ‘don’t/doesn’t (verb).\n\n1. I watch scary movies.\n2. Pete goes to the gym often.\n3. We like cats.\n4. She takes the bus to work.\n5. My brother lives in San Francisco.\n\n+ Submit to Show Answers"

        "content_md": "MISTAKE #1\n\nThai people often only use the word ‘not’ to make a sentence negative. Remember that ‘not’ is always used in conjunction with another verb to make a sentence negative, like in ‘It isn’t hot’ or ‘She doesn’t eat spicy food.’\n\nTake a look at the incorrect sentences below and how to fix them:\n\nI not have a dog. (X)\n* I don’t have a dog. (✓)\n\nThey not eat fish. (X)\n* They don’t eat fish. (✓)\n\nHe not like spicy food. (X)\n* He doesn’t like spicy food. (✓)\n\nMISTAKE #2\n\nIt’s also common for Thai people to mistakenly use ‘don’t’ in negative sentences when they should use ‘doesn’t.' Building the habit of using both correctly will make your English more accurate and fluent. Take a look at the corrections below:\n\nShe don’t drink beer. (X)\n* She doesn’t drink beer. (✓)\n\nHe don’t work there. (X)\n* He doesn’t work there. (✓)\n\nIt don’t smell bad. (X)\n* It doesn’t smell bad. (✓)"

        "content_md": "## LESSON FOCUS\n\nHow to use articles (a · an) before a noun\n\nEnglish uses 'articles,' which are small words that come before nouns. There are no articles at all in Thai! The three articles are: a, an, the. This lesson focuses on ‘a’ and ‘an.’\n\nARTICLES 'A’ & ‘AN'\n\nTake a look at the underlined nouns in these lines:\n\n* Sometimes I make a sandwich.\n* I usually just have a cup of coffee and an apple in the morning.\n* I need a big breakfast.\n\nNotice the small words that come before these nouns: ‘a’ and ‘an.’ These words are called ‘articles’ and are used very often in English. Although they’re small and don’t add meaning to a sentence, they’re very important for fluency. For example, saying ‘I need big breakfast’ sounds incomplete compared to ‘I need a big breakfast.’\n\n‘A’ and ‘an’ come before a singular, non-specific noun.\n\n‘Singular’ means there is only one noun. You can think of ‘a · an’ as meaning ‘one.’ In Thai, you would specify if there’s ‘one’ noun only if it’s important to the conversation’s context, for example: ฉันมีหมาหนึ่งตัว แต่พี่ชายมีสองตัว. But in English, the use of articles means it’s always clear if you are referring to one item or more than one item. When you say, ‘I ate a banana,’ it’s clear you ate one banana.\n\n‘Non-specific’ means you are not talking about a specific item. Another article (the) is used for this, which you’ll learn about in the next lesson. For example, if you say ‘I saw a dog,’ this means you saw any dog, while if you say ‘I saw Jane’s dog,’ you are referring to a specific dog.\n\nThese concepts will become clearer as you see more examples.\n\n## A VS. AN\n\nTake a look at these lines from the conversation:\n\n* I eat a banana...\n* But sometimes I eat an orange, too.\n\nOne sentence uses ‘a,’ and the other uses ‘an.’ Deciding which to use depends on the first sound of the word after the article.\n\n        an (the next word begins with a vowel sound – a, e, i, o, u)\n        a (the next word begins with a non-vowel sound - called ‘consonants’)\n\nWhat’s the first sound in the word ‘banana?’ ‘Buh!’ Because ‘buh’ is a consonant sound, you need to use the article ‘a’ before this word. What about the first sound in ‘orange?’ It’s ‘oh!’ That’s a vowel sound, so ‘an’ would come before it.\n\nThe reason ‘an’ is used before vowel sounds is for flow and ease of pronunciation - saying ‘a orange’ is awkward compared to saying ‘an orange.’ You can see this in more examples from the conversation:\n\n* Usually an egg and bacon sandwich.\n* You sound like an old man.\n\nPronunciation note: ‘a’ as an article isn’t pronounced like the letter ‘A’, but is pronounced more like ‘uh.’\n\n## NOUNS & NOUN PHRASES\n\nThe articles ‘a’ and ‘an’ come before nouns, but they also come before noun phrases, which is an adjective + noun. In a noun phrase, choosing ‘a’ and ‘an’ depends on the first letter of the adjective, not the noun. Note that articles never come before adjectives alone - only adjectives that are followed by a noun.\n\nIn the conversation, Sylvie tells Mark:\n\n* You sound like an old man.\n\nIn this line, 'old man' is the noun phrase.\nOld = adjective\nMan = noun\n\nYou must use 'an' since the next word starts with the letter 'o', which is a vowel.\n\nHere are more examples of ‘a’ before nouns and noun phrases:\n\n* Emily wants a dog. (noun)\n* I’d like a glass of water, please. (noun)\n* Pailin goes to a good school. (noun phrase)\n* That was a bad movie. (noun phrase)\n\nAnd here are more examples of ‘an’ before nouns and noun phrases:\n\n* I have an idea. (noun)\n* Do you have an umbrella? (noun)\n* It’s an easy task. (noun phrase)\n* I’m wearing an orange shirt. (noun phrase)"

Some words begin with a silent ‘h’, so when they’re pronounced, they actually begin with a vowel sound, like the word ‘hour’ or ‘honest.’ Use ‘an’ before these words. For example:\n\n* We have an hour for lunch.\n* She's an honest person.\n\nSome words begin with the vowel ‘u’, but when pronounced, it sounds like a ‘y’ sound, like the word ‘university’ or 'European.' Use ‘a’ before these words. For example:\n\n* My daughter is a university student.\n* That's a European car.\n\nThat's why the rules for using 'a · an' focus on the first sound of the next word, not the spelling."

While pancakes, waffles, and French toast are iconic American breakfast foods, they aren't eaten on a daily basis, but rather might be eaten one day a week with the family.\n\nIn contrast, Thai breakfasts are generally hearty meals and tend to be savory. A cooked meal of rice or sticky rice served with meat is common, showing a preference for substantial, flavorful breakfasts. This contrasts with the American tendency to eat quick, sugary, and easily prepared foods to start the day."

        "content_md": "## LESSON FOCUS\n\nHow to use the article ‘the’ before a noun\n\nIn the previous lesson, you learned about the two articles ‘a’ and ‘an.’ There is one more article: the.\n\nFun fact: ‘The’ is the most commonly used word in the English language.\n\n‘THE’ FOR SPECIFIC THINGS\n\nRecall that ‘articles’ are small words that come before nouns. There are three articles: a, an, the. The key difference between ‘a · an’ and ‘the’ is:\n\na · an - used for non-specific things\nthe - used for specific things\n\nTake a look at this line from the conversation with the noun of focus underlined:\n\n* Check the yellow paper.\n\nLuke tells Pailin that she can find the Wi-Fi password on a specific yellow paper that's on the fridge. Because he is being specific, it is incorrect to say 'Check a yellow paper.' Then, Luke says to Pailin:\n\n* The coffee shop down the street has good Wi-Fi.\n\nAgain, he is referring to one specific coffee shop - the one down the street. Contrast this with a sentence like, 'A coffee shop will have good Wi-Fi.' If Luke said this, it means that any coffee shop will have good internet, so he would use 'a' instead of 'the.' But he wants to direct Pailin to a specific coffee shop nearby, so he says 'the coffee shop.'\n\nSee more explanations of the lines from the conversation below:\n\n* What’s the WIFI password?\nThere is only one specific WIFI password that Pailin is asking for.\n\n* It's on the fridge.\nMost homes have only one refrigerator, making it a specific object.\n\n* The internet is super slow today.\nA household typically has one internet service, and Luke is referring to that specific internet connection.\n\n* The library is also nearby.\nIn a neighborhood, there's usually one main library that everyone is familiar with. Luke is referring to the one that's closest to their home.\n\n‘THE’ FOR UNIQUE ITEMS\n\nTake a look at this line from the conversation:\n\n* The internet is super slow today.\n\nAlthough Luke is referring to the internet connection specifically in their home, 'the internet' in general is unique since there is only one internet. ‘An internet’ is never said because the idea of multiple internets doesn’t exist.\n\nSo for nouns that are unique, ‘the’ is the article used before, not ‘a · an.’ There are many different ‘unique nouns,’ so here are some select examples where ‘the’ should come before:\n\nPhysical environment: the stars, the moon, the grass, the ocean, the weather\nSystems and services: the police, the news, the electricity, the government\nGovernment positions: the Queen, the president\nConcepts: the economy, the future, the world\n\n‘THE’ FOR SPECIFIC THINGS ALREADY MENTIONED\n\nWhen you mention an item for the first time in a conversation, you should use ‘a’ or ‘an’ because it’s new information for the listener. However, after that item is mentioned, you should say ‘the’ because now it’s something that is known to both the speaker and listener. ‘The’ shows that the item is now a particular or familiar thing that everyone in the conversation is aware of.Here is an example:\n\n* Pailin: I saw a good movie yesterday.\nLuke: What was the movie about?\nPailin: The movie was about a man who traveled around the world.\n\nIn the beginning, Pailin says 'a good movie' because she's introducing the movie for the first time. She's not referring to a specific movie that Luke already knows about. It's a general introduction.  Then, once the 'good movie' is introduced into the conversation, Luke and Pailin can refer to it as 'the movie' because they both know which movie they're referring to. It's now specific.\n\nHere is another example referencing a person:\n\n* Mark: We have a new employee on the team.\nAssistant: Is the employee starting work this week?\nMark: I think so.\n\nAt first, Mark uses ‘a’ because he is introducing the employee into the conversation for the first time. The employee is unknown to the assistant. She doesn’t know who the new employee is or any details about them.\n\nBut once Mark introduces this employee into the conversation, the employee becomes known to both people in the conversation. Now they are both talking about the same person. So, the assistant uses ‘the’ because she is referring to the specific employee that Mark just mentioned. Later in the day, if the assistant wants to ask Mark more questions about this new employee, she will continue to say ‘the employee,’ rather than ‘a new employee.’\n\nThere are several more ways to use ‘the,’ which you can learn about in the Extra Tips section.\n\n'THE' BEFORE SINGULAR & PLURAL NOUNS\n\nYou learned in the previous lesson that 'a · an' is used before singular nouns only, meaning there is only one item or person. However, 'the' can be used before any quantity of people or things. For example:\n\n* The book is about a woman who becomes a chef.\n* The books on the shelf are old.\n\n* Can I eat the last cookie?\n* I ate all the cookies you baked.\n\nThe words ‘books’ and ‘cookies’ refer to more than one book and more than one cookie, yet ‘the’ can still be used."

        "type": "extra_tip",
        "sort_order": 3,
        "content_md": "'THE' FOR SPECIFIC THINGS IN ONE ENVIRONMENT\n\n'The' is used when talking about a specific place that everyone knows is the main one in your surroundings. When Luke refers to 'the library,' he isn't talking about any library. He's referring to the library that is most likely known or understood by Pailin in their current setting. It's the 'default' library, or the one considered the most obvious or accessible. This concept applies to other places you might go to in your neighborhood, such as:\n\nthe beach\n* Let's go to the beach.\nThere are beaches all over the world, but the listener will understand that you want to go to the main beach in your area.\n\nthe bathroom\n* I need to go to the bathroom.\nIt's understood that you want to use whichever bathroom is closest.\n\nthe park\n* My kids are playing at the park.\nThis implies a park in your neighborhood.\n\nMore examples:\nthe hospital\nthe airport\nthe museum\nthe movies\nthe lake\nthe post office\nthe bank\nthe bus station\nthe mall\n\n## 'THE' BEFORE SUPERLATIVES\n\n'The' is used before words that describe something as the 'most' or 'best' of its kind, like 'the tallest' or 'the fastest.' There can only be one specific thing that's 'the most,' which explains why 'the' is used. These words are called 'superlatives,' which you'll learn about in Lesson 8.11. Here are some example sentences:\n\n* Sarah is the smartest person in our class.\n* This is the best Thai restaurant in LA.\n* New Zealand is the most beautiful country I've been to.\n\n## 'THE' BEFORE TRANSPORTATION & INSTRUMENTS\n\nWhen referring to a mode of transportation or a musical instrument as a concept, you should use 'the.' For example:\n\n* I take the bus to work.\n* The subway is clean and reliable in Tokyo.\n* She plays the piano very well.\n* I want to learn how to play the guitar.\n\nHowever, context is important. When referring to a single instrument or vehicle, then 'a · an' might be used instead. For example:\n\n* We took a taxi to the airport.\n* She bought a piano."

        "content_md": "## LESSON FOCUS\n\nHow to use plural nouns\n\nIn Lesson 3.3, you learned what to say before a singular noun: 'a' or 'an'. In this lesson, you'll learn what to say if there is more than one noun. These are called plural nouns.\n\n## PLURAL NOUNS\n\nIn the conversation, Sylvie and Pailin are browsing in a flower shop. Sylvie says:\n\n* These roses smell amazing!\n* Let's get some flowers for the living room.\n\nNotice that the articles 'a' and 'an' aren’t before the words ‘roses’ and ‘flowers.’ That's because Sylvie is referring to multiple items. There are many roses that Sylvie can see, not just one. Then Sylvie suggests they get 'some' flowers for the living room, not just one flower.\n\nThe words ‘roses’ and ‘flowers’ are examples of ‘plural nouns.’ A plural noun represents multiple people, places, or things. Just by looking at the words ‘roses’ or ‘flowers,’ you can tell that there is more than one rose or flower because they are in their plural form.\n\nIn contrast, a ‘singular noun’ represents one person, place, or thing. The words ‘rose’ and ‘flower’ are singular nouns. Just by looking at these words, you can tell that there is only one rose or flower because they are in their singular form. To summarize:\n\nSingular noun: One person, place, or thing\nExamples: dog, kid, magazine, house\n\nPlural noun: 2 or more people, places, or things\nExamples: dogs, kids, magazines, houses\n\nNote: Remember that the articles ‘a’ and ‘an’ only come before singular nouns, while ‘the’ can come before both singular and plural nouns.\n\n## MAKING PLURAL NOUNS\n\nCompare these two lines from the conversation:\n\n* I like the blue vase.\n* The vases are over there.\n\nDo you see how the word ‘vase’ changed? It went from ‘vase’ to ‘vases.’ An -s was added to the end of the noun. This is generally how plural nouns are formed. The following lines from the conversation all have plural nouns. See if you can spot them:\n\n* Let’s get some flowers for the living room.\n* It’s 3 dollars for 1 lily.\n* Do you sell vases?\n\nThey are the words ‘flowers,’ ‘dollars,’ and ‘vases.’\n\n## SINGULAR NOUN\n## PLURAL NOUN\n\tflower\n\tflowers\n\tdollar\n\tdollars\n\tvase\n\tvases\n\n## APPLYING PLURAL NOUNS\n\nSometimes, it’s simple to know when to use plural nouns. When specifying a quantity, you would use the singular noun for 1, and the plural noun for amounts of 2 or more. For example:\n\n* It’s 3 dollars for 1 lily.\n* I’ll take 5 lilies, please.\n\n‘Dollars’ is plural because the worker specifies 3 of them. ‘Lily’ is singular in the first sentence because she specifies 1 of them. In the next line, ‘lilies’ is plural because Sylvie requests 5 of them.\n\nThose are more obvious scenarios. Sometimes, words like ‘some’ or ‘many’ indicate that you should use the plural noun. In other scenarios, using the singular noun versus plural noun depends on the context. Imagine you’re at an electronics store shopping for a new phone. Take a look at when you might use the singular and plural version of ‘phone’:\n\nYou’re looking at a specific phone that you like, when you notice the price:\n* I like this phone.\nYou should use the singular ‘phone’ because you are referring to only one phone, the one that you’re interested in.\n\n* These phones are on sale.\nThe plural ‘phones’ should be used if multiple phones are on sale.\n\nAlthough the meaning of the conversation might not change with singular or plural nouns, they're very important to use correctly if you want to sound like a native speaker.\n\n## IRREGULAR PLURAL NOUNS\n\nIn the conversation, Sylvie says:\n\n* My children love lilies.\n\n'Children' is a plural noun, but it doesn't have an -s at the end. Do you know what the singular noun is? It's 'child.' There are some words in English that don't follow the rule of adding -s to become plural, and instead just become a different word. These are called irregular plural nouns. Here are some common irregular plural nouns:\n\n## SINGULAR NOUN\n## PLURAL NOUN\n\ta man\n\tmen\n\ta women\n\twomen\n\ta child\n\tchildren\n\ta person\n\tpeople\n\ta foot\n\tfeet\n\ta tooth\n\tteeth"

Now, you can put a name to these: singular noun and plural nouns. Here is a recap:\n\n## SUBJECT\n## VERB\n## EXAMPLE SENTENCES\n\t(Plural noun)\n\tare\nwere\n(verb)\ndon’t (verb)\n\t* These boxes are heavy.\n* The buses were crowded.\n* My dogs love the dog park.\n* Those women don’t eat pork.\n\t(Singular noun)\n\tis\nwas\n(verbs)\ndoesn’t (verb)\n\t* This box is heavy.\n* The bus was crowded.\n* My dog loves the dog park.\n* That woman doesn’t eat pork.\n\n## WHEN THERE ARE 0 ITEMS\n\nYou've learned that singular nouns refer to 1 noun, while plural nouns refer to 2 or more nouns. Interestingly, when there are 0 nouns, the plural noun is used in the sentence! For example:\n\n* I don't have any sisters.\n* There aren't any dishes in the sink.\n* This shop doesn't sell notebooks.\n* I have no plans for the weekend.\n\n## PLURAL NOUNS FOR GENERAL QUESTIONS\n\nIn the conversation, Sylvie asks the worker:\n\n* Do you sell vases?\n\nShe uses the plural noun 'vases' instead of the singular noun 'vase' because she's asking a general question of whether the store sells a category of items. The store potentially sells multiple kinds of vases, so using the plural noun makes her question broader and more inclusive. It would sound unnatural for Sylvie to ask 'Do you sell a vase?'\n\nHere are more examples:\n\n* How many countries have you visited?\n* Do you like dogs?\n* Are there any restaurants open late?"

It's Luke's grandpa's watch. Notice the bolded 'apostrophe -s' added to 'grandpa' indicates that the watch belongs to his grandpa. When spoken, you simply add an -s sound after the owner’s name. Here is the structure:\n\n(the owner)'s (noun)\n\nThis possessive form shows a connection between two things, whether it's ownership, a relationship, or a characteristic. There are examples of each in the conversation:\n\n* Do you like Emily's paintings? (ownership)\n* My dad's friend fixed it last year. (a relationship)\n* That's my mom's jewelry box. (ownership)\n* This is my grandma's cookbook. (ownership)\n* My grandma's cooking was amazing. (a characteristic)\n\n## OMITTING THE NOUN\n\nNotice there isn’t a noun after ‘Emily’s’ in this sentence:\n\n* These are Emily's?\n\nPailin doesn't have to say 'These are Emily's paintings?' because the noun was already mentioned in the previous sentence when Luke asks 'Do you like Emily's paintings?' The same occurs in this line:\n\n* That's my mom's jewelry box. It was my grandma's before that.\n\nThere isn’t a noun after ‘grandma’s’ because the noun ‘jewelry box’ was already mentioned in the previous sentence. So, you can omit the noun when it's clear what you're talking about. This is different from possessive adjectives, which you learned about in Lesson 2.9. Remember that possessive adjectives (my · your · her…) also show possession, but they must come before a noun. You cannot omit the noun after it.\n\n* A: I like this jacket.\nB: Thanks, it’s my jacket. (✓)\nB. Thanks, it's my. (X)"

It's a way to buy time while you think about your response.\n\n* Luke: What time should we leave for the airport?\nPailin: Let's see, our flight is at 9, so let's leave around 6.\nPailin is calculating the time needed to get to their flight on time.\n\n* Pailin: How many people are coming to your party?\nLuke: There are...let's see, around 30 people coming.\nLuke is trying to count an approximate number.\n\n2. 'Let's see' is used when you want to observe the outcome of a situation, or want to try something out. It shows curiosity or an attempt to experiment.\n\n* Luke: Someone left a note on my car.\nPailin: Ooh, let's see what it says.\nPailin is curious about what is on the note.\n\n* Pailin: I'm not sure what to order. Everything on the menu looks so good.\nLuke: Let's see what the waiter recommends.\nLuke wants to try the waiter's recommendations, since they can't decide what to order.\n\n## LET'S GO\n\nThe phrase ‘Let’s go’ is typically said when you’re ready to leave a place. But it’s also used casually in two more ways:\n\n1. ‘Let’s go!’ can be used to show excitement for something happening now, or to show enthusiasm when your friend shares great news with you. It’s not used to talk about actually going to a place when used in this context.\n\n* Pailin: I won free tickets to the game tonight!\nLuke: Let’s go!\n\n2. ‘Let’s go’ can be used to motivate or encourage a sports team or player, especially when you’re a spectator.\n\n* Let's go Lakers!"

Notice what the worker at the ice cream shop says to Pailin, Chloe, and Anthony:\n\n* How are you guys today?\n\nHe uses the phrase 'you guys.'

Anthony says 'you guys' even when talking to two women, Pailin and Chloe.\n\nNotice that 'you guys' follows the same verb conjugation pattern as 'you · we · they,' since it's a plural subject:\n\n* Are you guys paying together or separately?\n* Are they paying together or separately?\n\nHere are more examples of 'you guys' in a sentence:\n\n* I'll see you guys later.\n* You guys should try this new restaurant.\n* Where are you guys going on vacation?"

For example:\n\n* Guys, look at this!\n* Come over here, guys!\n* You guys, what time should we leave?\n\nRemember that any gender can use the terms 'you guys' or 'guys.' A woman can say to her two female friends, 'Guys, where should we eat?'\n\nIn larger group settings, you can also use the word 'everyone.' This is a more gender-neutral term and is more formal than 'guys.' For example, a teacher on a field trip with her students might say:\n\n* Everyone, follow me!\n\n## GUYS & GIRLS\n\nYou’ve learned that ‘guys’ is a gender-neutral way to address a group of people of any gender. But ‘guys’ can be used to talk specifically about a group of boys or men when you are talking about them, not directly to them. For example:\n\n* We have 50 spots for girls and 50 spots for guys.\n* Will there be other guys at the party?\nIf you invited a male friend to your house party, he might ask this to find out if he will be the only man there, or if there will be other men there too."

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to ask any question in present simple tense using 'Do...?' or 'Does...?'\n\n## DO...?\n\nIn the conversation, Chloe asks Pailin about Anthony and his sister:\n\n* Do they talk often?\n\nThe question is made by adding ‘Do’ to the beginning of the present simple tense sentence ‘They talk often.’ So, ‘Do’ changes a statement into a yes/no question.\n\nHere are more examples:\n\n* Do I speak English well?\n* Do we have homework?\n* Do your parents live in England?\n\nKeep in mind that ‘Do’ is used for these subjects: I, you, we, they, 2+ nouns\n\n## DOES...?\n\nCompare these two questions from the conversation:\n\n* Do they talk often?\n* Does he come to LA often?\n\nNotice how the first word changed in the question from 'Do' to 'Does.' This is because the subject is different. When making questions with the subjects 'he · she · it · noun,' the question must begin with 'Does.'\n\nNow take a look at the main verb that's underlined in these two lines:\n\n* His sister lives in LA.\n* Does he drive a motorcycle?\n\nIn the first sentence, -s is added to the end of verb because it follows ‘he · she · it · noun.’ What do you notice about the second line? The verb doesn’t have an -s even though the subject is ‘he’. Instead, the questioning auxiliary verb ‘Do’ takes the -s to become ‘Does,’ while the main verb ‘drive’ stays in its base form.\n\nYou might remember that the same rule applies to negative present simple tense sentences:\n\n* He drives a motorcycle.\n* He doesn’t drive a motorcycle.\n\nThe negative auxiliary verb ‘does not’ takes the -s, while the main verb ‘drive’ stays in its base form.\n\n## USES & STRUCTURE\n\nRecall that present simple tense is used when talking about routines, habits, feelings, and general knowledge, like facts and widely accepted truths. In the same way, questions in present simple tense are used to ask about things that happen regularly, or for asking about how someone feels.\n\nHere is a breakdown of forming questions using present simple tense.\n\n## AUXILIARY VERB\n## SUBJECT\n## VERB\n## EXAMPLE SENTENCES\n\tDo\n## I\nyou\nwe\nthey\n2+ nouns\n\t(verb)\n\t* Do I look okay?\n* Do you watch scary movies?\n* Do we need anything?\n* Do they live here?\n* Do Mark and Sylvie work together?\n\tDoes\n\the\nshe\nit\n1 noun\n\t(verb)\n\t* Does he speak Spanish?\n* Does she play the piano?\n* Does it snow in Thailand?\n* Does Sophia drive a car?\n\nQuick Practice: Change the affirmative sentences into questions.\n\n1. You eat breakfast every morning.\n2. Pete goes to the gym often.\n3. They take the bus to work.\n4. She visits Chicago every year.\n5. Your brother works from home.\n\n+ Submit to Show Answers"

(✓)\n\n* A: Do they eat meat?\nB: Yes, they do. (✓)\n\n* A: Does he want kids?\nB: No, he doesn't. (✓)\n\nMISTAKE #2\n\nIt’s common for Thai people to omit the question words ‘do’ or 'does' and simply ask:\n\nThey drink coffee? (X)\nShe live in Japan? (X)\n\nAlthough you can ask questions in this way (see Lesson 2.10), remember that this style of question is mainly used to confirm something you already suspect to be true. For general questions, it's important to begin your questions with 'Do' or 'Does,' so they become:\n\n* Do they drink coffee? (✓)\n* Does she live in Japan?

Compare these two lines from the conversation:\n\n* They have a lot of fun classes.\n* Emily has a yoga mat.\n\nNotice that 'have' doesn't become 'haves' when it follows the subject 'Emily.' Instead, it becomes the word 'has.' The words 'have' and 'has' are used frequently in English, so it's important to remember this rule.\n\nHere are more sentences with 'has' from the conversation:\n\n* It has a nice pool.\n* The gym down the street has a huge pool.\n\nRemember that in questions and negative sentences, the main verb 'have' would not be conjugated, but rather the auxiliary verb 'do' gets conjugated to become 'does.'\n\nNegative Sentences:\n* They don't have a pool.\n* It doesn't have a pool.\n\nQuestions:\n* Do they have yoga classes?\n* Does the gym have yoga classes?"

This lesson provides an overview of all the conjugations you have learned.\n\n## -S CONJUGATIONS\n\nThere is a simple rule you can remember for verbs that follow 'he · she · it · noun':\n\nThese verbs often end with -s.\n\nYou’ll see this pattern more clearly as you go through this lesson.\n\n## IS & WAS\n\nTake a look at these lines from the conversation:\n\n* My dad is a lawyer.\n* My mom's family is from France.\n* My mom is a nurse.\n* He was a personal trainer for celebrities in Thailand.\n\nThe to-be verbs 'is' and 'was' both end in -s, since the subject is 'he · she · it · noun.' Compare the above sentences to those below, where the verb doesn't have an -s ending:\n\n* They are lawyers.\n* We are from France.\n* I am a nurse.\n* You were a personal trainer for celebrities in Thailand.\n\n## PRESENT SIMPLE TENSE VERBS\n\nTake a look at these lines from the conversation:\n\n* My mom has a wine business.\n* She knows a lot about wine.\n* She has a glass of wine every night.\n* My dad only drinks on holidays.\n* My dad manages a gym.\n* Yeah, he does.\n\nThese verbs have -s at the end, since the subject is 'he · she · it · noun.' Remember that 'have' becomes 'has', not 'haves.' Also remember that 'do' becomes 'does', not 'dos.' Compare the above sentences to those below, where the verb doesn't have an -s ending:\n\n* They have a wine business.\n* I know a lot about wine.\n* We have a glass of wine every night.\n* You only drink on holidays.\n* They manage a gym.\n* Yeah, we do.\n\n## NEGATIVE VERBS & QUESTIONS\n\nTake a look at this line from the conversation:\n\n* My mom doesn't drink alcohol.\n\nRemember that 'do not' becomes 'does not,' which still follows the rule of having an -s ending - it’s just that the auxiliary verb ‘do not’ takes the -s to become ‘does not.’ This goes for questions, too, where the question word ‘Do’ takes the -s to become ‘Does’:\n\n* Does your dad work out often?\n\nCompare the above sentences to those below, where neither the main verb nor the auxiliary verb ‘do’ has an -s ending:\n\n* They don't drink alcohol.\n* Do you work out often?\n\nWhew! That was a lot. Now you see how common it is to have -s endings for verbs with the subjects 'he · she · it · noun.' Remember to practice pronouncing that -s sound, and you'll get the hang of it!"

Intentions or plans made for the future:\n* I'll finish the report by Friday.\n\n2. Decisions made at the moment of speaking:\n* *doorbell rings* I'll get it!\n\n3. Predictions for things you believe will happen:\n* It'll rain tomorrow.\n\n4. Promises you will commit to doing:\n* I'll help you with your job application when I finish work.\n\n5. Offers to help someone:\n* Those bags look heavy. I'll carry them for you.\n\nTake a look at what the affirmative sentences from the conversation demonstrate:\n\n* I'll run some errands first.\nAn intention or plan\n\n* I'll ask her to pick you up.\nAn offer or promise\n\n* I'll get some vinyls for my parents.\nA plan or intention\n\n* They'll love that.\nA prediction\n\n* I'll bring my camera.\nA decision made at the moment of speaking\n\n* It'll be fun!\nA prediction\n\n* I'll text you when we leave the house.\nA promise\n\n## AFFIRMATIVE SENTENCE STRUCTURE\n\nIn these three sentences, take a look at the main verb:\n\n* I'll get some vinyls for my parents.\n* I'll bring my camera.\n* I'll text you when we leave the house.\n\nNotice that 'I'll' comes before each verb:\n\nI'll = I will\n\nThe full sentences are:\n\nI will get some vinyls for my parents.\nI will bring my camera.\nI will text you when we leave the house.\n\nThe word 'will' is an auxiliary verb that indicates you are speaking about the future. However, you should contract the subject with 'will' when speaking, as 'I'll' is easier and quicker to say than 'I will.'\n\nNow take a look at this line that also uses future simple tense:\n\nMy host mom will drop me off.\n\nAlthough 'my host mom' is a 3rd person subject, neither the auxiliary verb 'will' nor the main verb 'drop' has an -s ending! Lucky for you, the grammar of future simple tense sentences is straightforward. The sentence structure is the same for all subjects!\n\nHere is the structure of affirmative future simple tense sentences. Note that you can contract pronouns with 'will,' but you can't do this with subjects like 'My host mom' or 'The store.'\n\n## SUBJECT\n## AUXILIARY VERB\n## VERB\n## EXAMPLE SENTENCES\n## I\nYou\nWe\nThey\n2+ Nouns\nHe\nShe\nIt\n1 Noun\n\twill\n\t(verb)\n\t* I'll quit my job next month.\n* You'll like the movie tonight.\n* We'll have a meeting tomorrow.\n* They'll arrive at 5PM.\n* My kids will have tennis lessons tonight.\n* He'll finish the project by Friday.\n* She'll call you later today.\n* It'll rain soon.\n* The train will leave at midnight.\n\n## NEGATIVE SENTENCE STRUCTURE AND USES\n\nIn the conversation, Pailin says:\n\n* I won't be free until 1PM.\nwon't = will not\n\nPailin says that she will not be available until 1PM, a time in the future. So, she uses 'will not' in her sentence. Note that 'will not' becomes 'won't' when contracted, not 'willn't.'\n\nNegative sentences in future simple tense are mostly used for:\n\n1. Predictions for things you expect will not happen in the future:\n* They won't win the game.\n\n2. Refusals for things you are unwilling to do:\n* I won't go to the party if you don't go.\n\n3. Promises for things you will refrain from doing:\n* I won't tell anyone your secret.\n\n4. Showing a future absence, closure, or unavailability:\n* The store won't be open tomorrow, since it's a holiday.\n\nPailin's line 'I won't be free until 1PM' is an example of future unavailability.\n\nHere is the structure of negative future simple tense sentences.\n\n## SUBJECT\n\t(-)\n## VERB\n## EXAMPLE SENTENCES\n## I\nYou\nWe\nThey\n2+ Nouns\nHe\nShe\nIt\n1 Noun\n\twon’t\n\t(verb)\n\t* I won't be at work tomorrow.\n* You won't finish the project on time.\n* We won't go to the party.\n* They won't take the train.\n* My parents won't come for Christmas.\n* He won't do the dishes.\n* She won't lend me money.\n* It won't snow tomorrow.\n* The bus won't arrive on time.\n\n## QUESTION STRUCTURE AND USES\n\nIn the conversation, Pailin asks Chloe:\n\n* Will you take the metro to the Walk of Fame?\n\nCompare this to the affirmative sentence:\n\n* You will take the metro to the Walk of Fame.\n\nTo form questions in future simple tense, simply switch the position of the subject and the auxiliary verb 'will.'\n\nQuestions in future simple tense are mostly used for:\n\n1. Requests to politely ask someone to do something in the future:\n* Will you help me organize the closet after dinner?\n\n2. Asking about future plans, intentions, or events:\n* Will you take the bus to work?\n\n3. Asking about future predictions and outcomes:\n* Will it rain tomorrow?\n\nPailin's question 'Will you take the metro to the Walk of Fame?' is an example of asking about Chloe's future plans.\n\nHere is the structure of future simple tense questions.\n\n## AUXILIARY VERB\n## SUBJECT\n## VERB\n## EXAMPLE SENTENCES\n\tWill\n## I\nyou\nwe\nthey\n2+ nouns\nhe\nshe\nit\n1 noun\n\t(verb)\n\t* Will I see you at the meeting tomorrow?\n* Will you go to the store later?\n* Will we be late?\n* Will they come to the wedding?\n* Will your parents retire this year?\n* Will he finish the report on time?\n* Will she call me later?\n* Will it be sunny tomorrow?\n* Will the store be open on Sunday?"

        "content_md": "## SHORT FORM ANSWERS\n\nRemember that yes/no questions can be answered with a simple ‘Yeah’ or ‘No,’ but sometimes a short form answer is given to maintain the flow of conversation. To answer ‘Will...?' questions, you should use either the words 'will' or 'won't' in your answers, NOT the main verb. Note that you shouldn't contract the subject with 'will' in these answers - it sounds awkward to say 'Yes, I'll,' so remember to stick with 'Yes, I will.'\n\nIn the conversation, notice how Chloe answers Pailin's question:\n\n* Pailin: Will you take the metro to the Walk of Fame?\nChloe: No, I won't.\n\nHere are more examples:\n\n* Luke: Will the library be open tomorrow?\nPailin: Yeah, it will.\n\n* Pailin: Will you help me cook dinner tonight?\nLuke: Yeah, I will.\n\n* Pailin: Will Alex take that job offer?\nLuke: No, he won't."

(✓)\n\nWe will be late if we take the train.\nThis is fine to say, but it sounds better as:\n* We'll be late if we take the train. (✓)"
