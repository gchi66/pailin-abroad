      "content_md": "### Lesson focus: How to use the modal verb ‘can’  \n\nYou will use the verb **can** often in English. It has simple grammar and has two main uses: to show **permission** and **ability**. These lines from the conversation demonstrate both:\n\n- **You can** sit at the table over there in the corner.  \n  _Permission: The host is allowing Pailin and Enzo to sit at that specific table._\n\n- **I can** snack on the chips.  \n  _Ability: Enzo is unable to eat the salsa because he’s allergic, but he’s able to eat the chips._\n\nWhile Thai might use different words to demonstrate permission and ability, English uses **can** for both. The best part? The grammar is simple! The structure stays the same no matter what the subject of the sentence is.\n\n```\n(Subject) can (verb)\n```\n\n**Examples showing permission:**\n- You can borrow my pen.\n- We can park our car on the street.\n- You can bring a guest to the party.\n\n**Examples showing ability:**\n- Chloe can speak three languages.\n- My dad can sing really well.\n- I can run a mile in 6 minutes.\n\n---\n\n## Negative sentences\n\nThe following negative sentences from the conversation demonstrate ability, or rather lack of ability, by using the word **can’t**:\n\n> I don’t have my glasses, so **I can’t read** the menu.  \n> I **can’t eat** the salsa. I’m allergic to tomatoes.\n\nEnzo is unable to read the menu without his glasses, and he’s unable to eat salsa because he’s allergic to tomatoes.\n\nThe structure of negative sentences is also simple:\n```\n(Subject) can’t (verb)\n```\n**‘Can’t’** is a contraction of **cannot**. Because **can** and **can’t** sound so similar, they are easy words to misunderstand, even for native English speakers! Don’t be afraid to ask someone for clarification if you’re unsure whether they said **can** or **can’t**. While you can say the full word **cannot** if you’re worried about being misunderstood, it’s still much more common to say **can’t**.\n\n**Examples showing lack of permission:**\n- We can’t take photos in the museum.\n- You can’t park your car here. You’ll get a ticket.\n- I can’t use my phone at work. My boss will get angry.\n\n**Examples showing lack of ability:**\n- I can’t speak Spanish.\n- He can’t hear anything. It’s too noisy.\n- Emily can’t focus on her work. She’s distracted.\n\n---\n\n## Making questions\n\nTake a look at these questions from the conversation that use **can**:\n\n- Can I see your IDs, please?\n- Can we sit outside? It’s a bit loud inside.\n- Can we have the chips and salsa and two Heinekens, please?\n\nThese questions all demonstrate permission. The host is requesting permission to see their IDs. Pailin is asking if they’re allowed to sit outside. Pailin is requesting chips and salsa and two beers from the waiter.\n\nLook at this question from the conversation:\n\n> What can I get for you tonight?\n\nThis one is a little different. While it hints at ability, it’s really an offer of service and is a common phrase used by servers for taking orders.\n\nTo form questions, simply switch the position of the subject and **can**:\n\n```\nCan (subject) (verb)?\n```\n\n**Examples requesting permission:**\n- Can I use your phone?\n- Can we sit here?\n- Can I try on these shoes?\n\n**Examples asking about ability:**\n- Can you swim?\n- Can she speak Korean?\n- Can you finish the project by Friday?\n\n---\n\n## ‘Can’ is a modal verb\n\n‘Can’ is a type of verb called a **modal verb**, which you can think of as a ‘helping’ verb. Modal verbs ‘help’ the main verb of a sentence by adding extra meaning or context. For example:\n\n> I can snack on the chips.  \n> **Can** = modal (helping) verb  \n> **Snack** = main verb\n\nWithout the modal verb **can**, the sentence ‘I snack on chips’ would imply a regular activity or routine (present simple). **Can** alters the meaning by suggesting ability or permission.\n\nThe verb **will** is another modal verb you learned about in Lesson 3.12. Other common modal verbs include:\n- could\n- should\n- would\n- might\n- must\n\nThe great thing about modal verbs is their grammar is simple: modals never change form based on the subject."

This means that at 18, you can vote, join the military, get married, and move out of your parents’ home, but you can’t buy alcohol or cigarettes until 21."
